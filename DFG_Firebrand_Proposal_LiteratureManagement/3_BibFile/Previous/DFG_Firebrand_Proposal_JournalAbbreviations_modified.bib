At first glance, the complex ignition, fire spread processes, and degree of gaseous and particulate emissions appear daunting during these large-scale destructive events. As part of this perspective paper, fundamental combustion science is discussed as a critical need to unravel these complex physical processes observed in large outdoor fires. An important aspect is that many of the detailed physics of these processes have yet to be fully revealed. In turn, this is a major barrier to developing computational methods to be able to predict and understand how large outdoor fires spread.

An important simplifying assumption made in early research into ember transport is the terminal-velocity assumption, in which embers are assumed to always fly at their terminal velocity relative to the wind field. With increases in computational power, it is now possible to directly simulate the atmospheric conditions resulting from wildfires and such simulations can resolve the larger of the turbulent processes involved. Because of the time-scales at which these processes occur, the terminal-velocity assumption may not be justified when modelling ember transport using these simulations. In this study we use a large eddy simulation of a turbulent plume to examine the validity of the terminal-velocity assumption when modelling the long-range transport of non-combusting embers. The results indicate that the use of the terminal-velocity assumption significantly overestimates the density of ember landings at long range, particularly for embers with higher terminal fall speeds.},

	abstract = {Aerodynamics of the ﬁrebrands' ﬂight is fundamental to ﬁre spotting; yet, this phenomenon is relatively poorly understood. Variants of Tachikawa's transport models have been developed for different shapes of debris but, only simpliﬁed versions are implemented in ﬁrebrand transport models. Failure to include lift and rotational forces reduces the problem to a two-dimensional one, in contrast to the 3D trajectories observed. As such, many studies may have under-/overestimated the ﬂight distance and failed to capture the spotting distribution, accurately. Also, there is virtually no detailed quantitative experimental validation available for rod-like debris transport models. Hence, a set of free-fall experiments with non-combusting model ﬁrebrands were run in the absence of cross-wind. The results are employed for veriﬁcation and performance evaluation of a 3D deterministic 6-{DegreesOf}-Freedom ({DOF}) rod-like debris transport model. It is shown that a transport model must include the complete 6-{DOF} aerodynamics of the debris for estimating the ﬂight characteristics, such that results are not statistically signiﬁcantly different from the experimental data. The ﬁndings have applications beyond ﬁrebrand transport, as they represent the most comprehensive experimental data set and analysis of rod-like debris transport, currently in the literature.},

	abstract = {Spotfires are a major problem in bushfire management, greatly complicate suppression efforts, and contribute to fires breaking control lines. Firebrands are often implicated in structure loss, and in extreme circumstances have been observed to ignite new fires over 30 km ahead of the parent fire. Existing prediction techniques do not accommodate the problem of such long-range spotting, and the meteorological and fire conditions that lead to such events are not well understood. We present a computationally inexpensive, physically based model of ember transport within bushfire plumes, with four components: an integral plume model, a model of turbulence within the plume, a probabilistic model of ember transport by the plume, and a model of transport beneath the plume. The predicted ember landing distributions from this model compare satisfactorily to the explicit ember-transport calculations of Thurston et al. (2017) and to observations (Cruz et al., 2012). We examine the sensitivity of the simple model to its input parameters. The 90th percentile of spotting distance increases with increasing fire power and decreases with increasing ember terminal fall velocity and fire radius. Where there is a meteorological inversion or stable layer and the plume updraft is sufficiently strong to carry embers to that height, the stable layer substantially limits the transport distance, with increased height favoring longer-range transport. The effect of wind speed is complex, due to the competing factors of faster horizontal transport but suppressed vertical plume development with stronger winds.},

Cylinders were used to simulate ﬁrebrand ﬂuxes from vegetation, such as trees, while disks were used to simulate a ﬁrebrand ﬂux from burning structures. Samples of these geometries were constructed from wood dowels, fed into the ﬁrebrand generator, ignited, and the glowing ﬁrebrands generated were collected using an array of water ﬁlled pans. The pans were ﬁlled with water in order to quench combustion. The collected ﬁrebrands were subsequently dried and the size and mass distribution was measured. These experiments were performed over a range of wind tunnel speeds, with no wind speed present to 9 m/s, to determine the lofting distance of the ﬁrebrands generated. Finally, the size and mass distribution produced from the ﬁrebrand generator are compared to those produced from burning trees. Results of the study are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Attempting to experimentally quantify the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from ﬁrebrand showers has remained elusive. The coupling of two facilities has begun to unravel this difﬁcult problem. The {NIST} Firebrand Generator ({NIST} Dragon) is an experimental device that can generate a ﬁrebrand shower in a safe and repeatable fashion. Since wind plays a critical role in the spread of {WUI} ﬁres in the {USA} and urban ﬁres in Japan, {NIST} has established collaboration with the Building Research Institute ({BRI}) in Japan. {BRI} maintains one of the only full scale wind tunnel facilities in the world designed speciﬁcally for ﬁre experimentation; the Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility ({FRWTF}). The present investigation is aimed at extensively quantifying ﬁrebrand penetration through building vents using full scale tests. A structure was placed inside the {FRWTF} and ﬁrebrand showers were directed at the structure using the {NIST} Dragon. The structure was ﬁtted with a generic building vent, consisting of only a frame ﬁtted with a metal mesh. Six different mesh sizes openings were used for testing. Behind the mesh, four different materials were placed to ascertain whether the ﬁrebrands that were able to penetrate the building mesh assembly could ignite these materials. Reduced scale test methods afford the capability to test new vent technologies and may serve as the basis for new standard testing methodologies. As a result, a new experimental facility developed at {NIST} is presented and is known as the {NIST} Dragon’s {LAIR} (Lofting and Ignition Research). The {NIST} Dragon’s {LAIR} has been developed to simulate a wind driven ﬁrebrand attack at reduced scale. The facility consists of a reduced scale Firebrand Generator (Baby Dragon) coupled to a bench scale wind tunnel. Finally, a series of full scale experiments were conducted to visualize the ﬂow of ﬁrebrands around obstacles placed downstream of the {NIST} Dragon. Firebrands were observed to accumulate in front of these obstacles at a stagnation plane, as was observed when the structure was used for ﬁrebrand penetration through building vent experiments, due to ﬂow recirculation. The accumulation of ﬁrebrands at a stagnation plane presents a severe threat to ignitable materials placed near structures.},

	abstract = {Firebrand ignition of structures is a major factor in large outdoor ﬁre spread. Standard laboratory test methods are required to evaluate and compare the performance of diﬀerent building elements and/or vegetative fuels ability to resist ﬁrebrand ignition. It is important to determine full-scale assembly performance when exposed to ﬁrebrand showers since weak points in a given assembly can be investigated. Such studies will lead to determining the necessary conﬁguration of building component mock-ups that can be used in standard laboratory test methods. The basis of this paper is to present a comparison of results from full-scale rooﬁng assembly experiments, to mockups using the recently developed experimental capability at National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster ({NRIFD}). The results demonstrated that similar ﬁrebrand penetration behavior/ trends were observed for mock-ups of full-scale rooﬁng assemblies, as compared to experiments where full-scale rooﬁng assemblies were used, all under similar wind speeds. The experimental ﬁndings presented in this paper represent an important step to develop reduced-scale test methods for ﬁrebrand exposure.},

The ﬁrebrand transport is a highly stochastic and nonlinear problem which directly inﬂuences the spotting distribution. Hence, a coupled stochastic model of ﬁrebrand showers, that is thoroughly and systematically validated against large scale wind tunnel experiments of lofting and downwind transport of model ﬁrebrands, is presented.

	abstract = {Wildland and Wildland Urban Interface ({WUI}) ﬁres are an important problem in many areas of the world and may have major consequences in terms of safety, air quality, and damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the ecosystem. It is expected that with climate changes the wildland ﬁre and {WUI} ﬁre problem will only intensify. The spot ﬁre ignition of a wildland ﬁre by hot (solid, molten or burning) metal fragments/sparks and ﬁrebrands (ﬂaming or glowing embers) is an important ﬁre ignition pathway by which wildﬁres, {WUI} ﬁres, and ﬁres in industrial settings are started and may propagate. There are numerous cases reported of wildﬁres started by hot metal particles from clashing power-lines, or generated by machines, grinding and welding. Once the wildﬁre or structural ﬁre has been ignited and grows, it can spread rapidly through ember spotting, where pieces of burning material (e.g. branches, bark, building materials, etc.) are lofted by the plume of the ﬁre and then transported forward by the wind landing where they can start spot ﬁres downwind. The spot ﬁre problem can be separated in several individual processes: the generation of the particles (metal or ﬁrebrand) and their thermochemical state; their ﬂight by plume lofting and wind drag and the particle thermo-chemical change during the ﬂight; the onset of ignition (smoldering or ﬂaming) of the fuel after the particle lands on the fuel; and ﬁnally, the sustained ignition and burning of the combustible material. Here an attempt has been made to summarize the state of the art of the wildﬁre spotting problem by describing the distinct individual processes involved in the problem and by discussing their know-how status. Emphasis is given to those areas that the author is more familiar with, due to his work on the subject. By characterizing these distinct individual processes, it is possible to attain the required information to develop predictive, physics-base wildﬁre spotting models. Such spotting models, together with topographical maps and wind models, could be added to existing ﬂame spread models to improve the predictive capabilities of landscape-scale wildland ﬁre spread models. These enhanced wildland ﬁre spread models would provide land managers and government agencies with better tools to prescribe preventive measures and fuels treatments before a ﬁre, and allocate suppression resources and issue evacuation orders during a ﬁre.},

To describe the transition of the half-width of the cross section, the temperature elevation, and the velocity of ﬁre plumes along the trajectory, a similarity model was derived by dimensional analysis. This model is equivalent to that in a quiescent environment, with the cross-wind eﬀect embodied in the distance along the trajectory. Therefore, the derived model reasonably correlated the half-width of the cross section with the temperature elevation. It also obtained the measured temperature elevation at ground level (0.02 m above the ﬂoor) downwind of the ﬁre sources. In this evaluation, the correlation between the measured and computed data points was improved by introducing a virtual source that considered both the ﬁre source size and the crosswind velocity eﬀects.},

The first decking slab was made of pine and the second one was a thermoplastic composed of polypropylene and calcium carbonate. Flaming firebrands were produced by heating and igniting wood chips of different shapes (square, longitudinal and rectangular) with a cone calorimeter. The firebrands generated preserved their shape during their heating. Their projected area was between 0.07 and 12.00 cm2 and their mass ranged from 0.57 mg to 2.66 g. The location of flaming firebrands, the minimal mass and the minimal number of firebrands needed to ignite the slabs were analysed in order to determine the critical conditions of ignition. The ignition of the decking slab only occurred when the firebrands were positioned at the interstices of the wooden slabs and against the leg of the thermoplastic slabs. No ignition occurred when the firebrands were located on the surface of the decking slab. A minimum mass of firebrands of 0.31 g and 0.80 g was necessary to ignite the wooden slabs and the thermoplastic ones, respectively. Less firebrands were needed to ignite wooden slabs than thermoplastic ones.},

A cylindrical heater was used to model the firebrand, which allowed to control the incident radiative heat flux on the specimen, from the critical heat flux up to 25 {kW}/m2, for five different porosities of the fuel layer. Experimental ignition delay times were interpreted based on a theoretical model of the radiative heating of the fuel layer. Radiative heat transfer within the fuel layer was modeled by using the P1 approximation. In the limit of small ignition delay times an analytical expression was derived to correlate the inverse of the ignition time to the incident heat flux. This analytical expression is used to obtain the ignition temperature and effective properties for the forest fuel layers, namely the product of the fuel volume fraction by solid fuel density and solid heat capacity. Analytical solutions were found to be consistent with experimental data and a correlation relating the inverse of the non-dimensional time-toignition to the non-dimensional heat flux is provided.},

	abstract = {Spot ignition by wind-dispersed firebrands is an important factor in the spread of fire in large outdoor fires. However, the large probabilistic variability in its generation, transport, and ignition processes causes difficulty in quantifying its risk. In this study, a series of wind tunnel experiments was conducted to understand the proba­ bilistically varying characteristics of two among three processes involved in spot ignition, i.e., the generation and transport of firebrands. Analysis samples were generated by combusting a wood crib in an apparatus that sim­ ulates the behavior of a fully developed structural fire. The experimental parameters were the ejection height of firebrands, H, crosswind velocity, U∞, and thickness of wood stick used for assembling the wood crib, d. Utilizing the experimental results, the projected area of a firebrand and its transport distance downwind of a fire source were formulated based on simple physical considerations. However, because the obtained correlations represent deterministic relationships of the parameters, they were further incorporated into probability distributions (a truncated exponential distribution for the projected area and a truncated normal distribution for the transport distance) to enable the consideration of intrinsic variations. The obtained models reasonably reproduced the experimental results for both the projected area and transport distance. Although structural fire is the targeted type of fire source, the proposed models exhibit forms extensible to other types of fire sources.},

Specifically, the experiments investigate the role of upstream buildings on the accumulation of embers on the rooftops of a building. Experiments were run for three target buildings for three different wind directions per building. The upstream array of buildings varied in both layout (staggered and regular grids of buildings) and in terms of the number of upstream rows of buildings and streamwise spacing between the buildings. Results indicate that each of these parameters, i.e. spacing, layout, and number of rows, influences the accumulation rate. In all cases tested the mass of embers that accumulated on the rooftops was less than 18\% of the mass that would have accumulated were the building removed. For buildings with roof heights similar to those of the upstream buildings the accumulation rate increases by up to a factor of 10 compared to when there are no upstream buildings. The lowest spacing between buildings produced the largest accumulation. When the target building roof height was larger than upstream buildings, this change was less pronounced. However, the variability in the accumulation rate between nominally identical tests decreased when the upstream buildings were present.},

	abstract = {Spotting refers to the transport of burning pieces of firebrand by wind which, at the time of landing, may ignite new fires beyond the direct ignition zone of the main fire. Spot fires that occur far from the original burn unit are rare but have consequential ramifications since their prediction and control remains challenging. To facilitate their prediction, we examine three methods for quantifying the landing distribution of firebrands: crude Monte Carlo simulations, importance sampling, and large deviation theory ({LDT}). In particular, we propose an {LDT} method that accurately and parsimoniously quantifies the low probability events at the tail of the landing dis­ tribution. In contrast, Monte Carlo and importance sampling methods are most efficient in quantifying the high probability landing distances near the mode of the distribution. However, they become computationally intractable for quantifying the tail of the distribution due to the large sample size required. We also show that the most probable landing distance grows linearly with the mean characteristic velocity of the wind field. Furthermore, defining the relative landed mass as the proportion of mass landed at a given distance from the main fire, we derive an explicit formula which allows computing this quantity as a function of the landing distribution at a negligible computational cost. We numerically demonstrate our findings on two prescribed wind fields.},

Firebrands are a harbinger of damage to infrastructure; their effects particularly pose a threat to people living within the wildland-urban-interface, they can hamper the suppression of wildfire and block evacuation routes for communities and emergency services. Short-range firebrands which travel along with the wind, with little or no lofting, are particularly crucial in increasing fire front propagation and damaging structures situated close to the wildland-urban interface. In the Daylesford fire of 1962 in Australia, massive short-range spotting (the process of spot fire ignition and merging of spots caused by firebrands) occurred in the eucalyptus forest and increased the rate of fire spread by roughly three times more than that computed using an operational fire model. Similarly, long-range firebrands can be transported by the fire plume and ambient wind and can ignite new fire up to 30–40 km from the source of fire as observed in the 2009 Black Saturday fire in Australia.},

Different wind speeds and frictional coefficients between the sliding firebrands and the ground were considered. Simulations revealed several flow effects influencing the motion of firebrands on the ground, such as re-circulation flow in the wake of the dragon, a crossflow upwind of the blocks, and twin re-circulation regions on leeward and windward sides of the blocks. At lower wind speeds, firebrands were accumulated somewhere between the dragon and the blocks, consistent with observations in the previous measurements. At higher wind speeds, the firebrands tended to accumulate momentarily before the crossflow region and then accelerate through the gap between the blocks. Some accumulated in the leeward corner of the blocks. Firebrands displayed much more dispersion in the streamwise direction compared to the spanwise direction because the normal component of the Reynolds stress was greater in the streamwise direction.},

We make use of four recent large-scale fires in Sweden to elucidate which factors are important for survival, using multiple logistic regression analysis of data collected at the sites. We obtained data on 187 buildings within the fire perimeters, nearly all with wood paneling and tile- or sheet metal roofing. 35 \% of the buildings were lost or badly damaged. Results indicate that most buildings were approached by relatively low-intensity fire and that ignition primarily occurred through direct flame contact. The most important factor for survivability was the presence of a maintained lawn. The second most important was that no flammable material was present close to the building façade. Further, fire intensity often decreased close to buildings due to a larger portion of deciduous trees around gardens than in the surrounding forest. These factors were more important than specific features of the building itself, reflecting that the majority of buildings have combustible wooden façades. Our results suggest that the greatest potential for increasing building safety in the Swedish {WUI} is to keep the area immediately surrounding the building ({\textasciitilde}5 m) free from tree litter and other flammable material. Also, since fire intensities are generally low, buildings can in most cases be defended with simple tools without compromising personal safety.},

The breakage model is then coupled to a plume model to form a description of the breakage, transport, and mass loss of branching vegetative fuel packets in wildland ﬁre scenarios.

This paper will focus on how these detailed database results are being used to generate firebrand showers using a redesigned firebrand generator experimental apparatus installed in a full-scale wind tunnel, with the intent to experimentally simulate firebrand showers produced from structure combustion in large outdoor fires.},

	abstract = {A stochastic model motivated by the Lagrangian transported probability density function method for turbulent reacting flows and the cellular automata approach for forest fires was put together to simulate propagation of fires in terrains with inhomogeneous composition. In contrast to the usual cellular automata models for fires where the probability of ignition is prescribed, here the ignition of cells is determined by a random walk that mimics turbulent convection and diffusion of the hot gases and firebrands from upwind and neighbouring fire fronts. Radiation is also included. The model is aimed at speed of computation while approximating the key physics through only a few terrain-related inputs and tunable parameters representing fire intensity, hot gas and ember decay timescales, cell ignition delay and local turbulence. These parameters were calibrated against controlled fire experiments and the model was then used to give reasonable predictions for fires of increasing complexity. The presented framework allows improvements for more accurate representation of the flammable material characteristics, fire-induced flow modifications, and most other phenomena present in fires, hence providing an extendable and simple yet physically-realistic novel modelling approach. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Wildland fires that spread into developed areas, i.e., the wildland-urban interface ({WUI}), have resulted in numerous disasters over the past few decades, claiming the lives of civilians and causing large-scale property destruction. In these communities, fires often ignite structures by the deposition of small burning embers (firebrand attack) which is unique to these fires and not yet well understood. This study quantifies the in-flight thermal characteristics of firebrands generated by three typical vegetative fuels, namely stone pine, eucalyptus and oak found in the {WUI}, inside a lab-scale wind tunnel. The effects of fuel characteristics (i.e., species, moisture content and twig diameter) and ambient condition (i.e., crosswind speed) on surface temperature, number generation rate ({NGR}), and heat release rate ({HRRfb}) were investigated. Firebrand surface temperatures, measured using ratio pyrometry, were insensitive to fuel moisture content and mean twig diameter but higher at higher crosswind speeds. Surface temperature was used to estimate the {HRRfb} of each firebrand based on a surface energy balance and compared to overall emissions measurements. While ratio pyrometry best captured firebrand temperatures, infrared video worked well to track firebrands and derive a {NGR} as a function of time. Correlations were used to organize the {NGR}, {HRRfb}, and mass generation rate ({MGR}) under different test conditions, and unique correlations were derived for each fuel species. Results showed that the peak {NGRs} and {MGRs} for all three fuel species were positively related to crosswind speed but negatively related to fuel moisture content and mean twig diameter. The experimental data, correlations and methods disclosed in this study are important to understand the influence of competing processes on firebrand generation, parameterize fire spread models for time-dependent generation, and improve estimates of downstream ignition potential. Experiments must later be validated against large-scale data before widespread application.},

In this work, the ability of firebrand accumulations to cause flaming ignition of an engineered wood material, Oriented Strand Board ({OSB}), under different flow conditions was experimentally studied. The firebrands were emulated by burning wooden dowels of two sizes, 6.35 \& 12.7 mm. Firebrands were dropped onto on the fuel to form accumulations, with the coverage densities of 0.06 to 0.16 g∕cm2 on the fuel surface. The surface temperature of glowing combustion on the firebrands was measured with color ratio pyrometry. The ignition outcome results show a similar hyperbolic relationship between air flow and coverage density for both firebrand sizes although accumulations of small firebrands can cause the ignition faster. A firebrand combustion model was adopted to predict the surface temperature of accumulated firebrands considering re-radiation between nearby firebrands. A correlation between the ignition time and characteristics of accumulations was also established based on a theoretical combustion and heat transfer analysis.},

Firebrands can not only cross fuel breaks and thwart other suppression efforts but also directly damage infrastructure and block evacuation routes. Transport models and computational fluid dynamics tools often make simplifications when predicting spot fire risk, but there is a relative lack of experimental data to validate such parameterizations. To this end, we present a field experiment performed at the University of California Berkeley Blodgett Research Forest in California where we recorded the flame and firebrands emanating from a nighttime hand-drawn pile fire using high-frequency imaging. We used image-processing to characterize the fire intensity and turbulence as well as particle tracking velocimetry to measure ejected firebrand kinematics as they are lofted by the plume. We further collected embers that settled around the fire at varying distances and measured their size, shape, density, and settling distributions. We also examine existing physics-based time-averaged models of firebrand lofting and note discrepancies between such models, often used due to their speed and simplicity, and our experimental observations. Finally, we discuss some implications our observations could have on future modeling efforts by considering the time-dependent fire dynamics, intermittency in the plume turbulence, and in the firebrand generation rate. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first in situ observations of firebrand generation and lofting from representative fuels, addressing a major source of data gap and uncertainty in the wildland fire literature.},

            Increased forest fire activity across the western United States in recent decades has contributed to widespread forest mortality, carbon emissions, periods of degraded air quality, and substantial fire suppression expenditures. Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western {US} forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.
          , 
            Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States ({US}) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western {US} forests over the past several decades and, during 2000–2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({\textgreater}1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western {US} forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984–2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

              ), but enumeration of the total number of firebrands released has remained elusive. Recently, a fire-resistant fabric was successfully employed to quantify “hot” firebrands (i.e., can potentially lead to further fire spread) generated during tree-scale burns. In this paper, a total of 71 tree/shrubs were burned to quantify hot firebrand production statistics for Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and sagebrush. A network of 65 fire-resistant fabric stations were deployed during the burns to measure the “hot” firebrands that are released. These stations are placed strategically at several radii and angles in the prominent wind direction. Using the number of firebrands determined from the fabric, a first-order extrapolation method was developed and evaluated to estimate the source terms (i.e., total number of hot firebrands released). Variation in the firebrand production with the height of the trees and for three species is reported. The total number of hot firebrands produced typically increased with the height of the tree/shrub burned as expected. The specific hot firebrand production (firebrands produced per kg dry mass burned) is exponentially dependent on the moisture content of the tree and had an inconclusive correlation with the height of the trees. Overall, for trees of comparable moisture content, sagebrush produced higher specific hot firebrands when compared to ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir species.},

Additionally, the ﬂame height, tree mass decay, vertical ﬂow velocity, and temperature at the top of the trees were measured during the experiments. The relationship between the various parameters was analyzed and a good connection was found. The specimens burnt were mostly young trees, so large particles (e.g., pine cones, thick trunk barks, branches) were not included in this study as they were not present. Actually, the ﬁrebrands produced in the laboratory tests, mainly burning leaves, had a cross-sectional area of {\textless} 1,600 mm2, having the potential to cause short distance spotting (up to tens of meters). Quercus trees are often considered to have a lower ﬁre risk than eucalyptus or pine trees. However, in this study, Quercus suber and Quercus robur were the species that produced more ﬁrebrands, both in terms of number and total volume. The tests with Quercus suber were the only ones using specimens from an adult tree, conﬁrming the great importance of the age of trees in the propensity to release ﬁrebrands. The results obtained with Quercus robur conﬁrmed the high tendency of this species to originate spot ﬁres at a short distance. Thus, these results are of great relevance to afforestation plans and to evaluating the risk of the presence of these species in wildland–urban interface areas.},

	abstract = {Firebrands are critical in spreading fires by potentially causing secondary spot fires when dispersed by fire plumes and wind, and deposited into combustible materials. This paper is on the simulations of dispersion and deposition of firebrands by a round turbulent jet and their validation against the previous experimental data (Wadhwani et. al 2017). Firebrands were non-burning with cubiform and cylindrical shapes. Simulations were conducted by Fire Dynamic Simulator ({FDS}) with the large eddy simulation ({LES}) of turbulence representing the subgrid scales by the Modified Deardorff model and the particle Lagrangian tracking of dispersed firebrands. This took the translational motion into account but not the rotational motion for particles. First, simulations were performed without particles for free turbulent planar and round jets to validate the {FDS} flow solver in these configurations. For both jets, although the simulated mean velocities overall conformed to their respective self-similar profiles, the planer jet mean velocity displayed more consistency with these profiles. In both jets, the difference between the simulated Reynolds stresses and their previously measured values by others were within 30\%. Then, simulations were preformed with firebrands in a computational configuration resembling the experimental firebrand generator setup of Wadhwani et. al (2017). Since the number of simulated firebrands was limited (210 particles), an accurate calculation of the landed firebrand distribution was not possible. However, the deposited cubiform firebrand pattern seemed to be more consistent with the previous experimental and simulation results than the deposited cylindrical firebrands. This may be attributed to the fact that the neglect of rotational motion was more critical to cylindrical firebrands.},

Therefore, in this study, a novel work of encompassing a wide range of factors attributing to the recent bushﬁres is presented. Empirical evidence‐based statistical methods are used to identify the hydroclimatic variables and geomorphic characteristics contributing to the 2019–2020 bushﬁres. The results highlight that ongoing drought, surface soil moisture ({SSM}), wind speed ({WS}10), relative humidity ({RH}), heat waves ({HW}), dead and live fuel moisture, and certain land cover types create favorable conditions for ﬁre ignition and aid in ﬁre propagation in different regions of the {NSW} state. The ﬁndings suggest that accounting for the above‐identiﬁed variables in bushﬁre prediction and monitoring system are crucial in avoiding such catastrophes in the future. The overarching application of this study is developing robust and more versatile ﬁre protection planning and management. Plain Language Summary Since the 2019–2020 Australian bushﬁres were catastrophic in terms of burnt area and severity, a detailed analysis of the primary causes is crucial. In this paper, several probable causes are tested statistically to establish their relationship with the burnt area. The results indicate that the ongoing drought, surface soil moisture, wind speed, relative humidity, heat waves, dead and live fuel moisture, and land cover with certain vegetation (particularly native eucalyptus and grazing land) are the primary causes of the widespread bushﬁre. These results are extremely critical in updating the current bushﬁre planning and management.},

	abstract = {Detection and analysis of the objects in a frame or a sequence of frames (video) can be used to solve a number of problems in various ﬁelds, including the ﬁeld of ﬁre behaviour and risk. A quantitative understanding of the short distance spotting dynamics, namely the ﬁrebrand density distribution within a distance from the ﬁre front and how distinct ﬁres coalesce in a highly turbulent environment, is still lacking. To address this, a custom software was developed in order to detect the location and the number of ﬂying ﬁrebrands in a thermal image then determine the temperature and sizes of each ﬁrebrand. The software consists of two modules, the detector and the tracker. The detector determines the location of the ﬁrebrands in the frame, and the tracker compares the ﬁrebrand in diﬀerent frames and determines the identiﬁcation number of each ﬁrebrand. Comparison of the calculated results with the data obtained by the independent experts and experimental data showed that the maximum relative error does not exceed 12\% for the low and medium number of ﬁrebrands in the frame (less than 30) and software agrees well with experimental observations for ﬁrebrands {\textgreater} 20 9 10-5 m. It was found that ﬁreline intensity below 12,590 {kW} m-1 does not change signiﬁcantly 2D ﬁrebrand ﬂux for ﬁrebrands bigger than 20 9 10-5 m, while occasional crowning can increase the ﬁrebrand ﬂux in several times. The developed software allowed us to analyse the thermograms obtained during the ﬁeld experiments and to measure the velocities, sizes and temperatures of the ﬁrebrands. It will help to better understand of how the ﬁrebrands can ignite the surrounding fuel beds and could be an important tool in investigating ﬁre propagation in communities.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, numerous large-scale disasters have occurred due to wildﬁres at the wildland-urban interface ({WUI}). In these ﬁres, spread via the transport of ﬁrebrands (burning embers) plays a signiﬁcant role. Several models have been developed to describe the transport of ﬁrebrands but few, if any, are available which can provide a quantitative means to generate ﬁrebrands at the source of a ﬁre. In this regard, a new methodology is proposed here that uses a wind tunnel to experimentally quantify the generation of ﬁrebrands from {WUI} fuels under diﬀerent ambient conditions. The setup allows for the collection of all generated solid ﬁrebrands and major downstream gaseous species concentrations. Unique ﬁrebrand yield correlations can then be generated for each tested fuel, while also accounting for the heatrelease rate, providing unique validation targets for numerical simulations. Generation of ﬁrebrands from branches of two conifers at a ﬁxed wind speed of 4 m/s are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of this new methodology. A carbon mass balance was utilized to analyze preliminary results and understand how much of the fuel mass transitions to ﬁrebrands vs. gases. These results provide a description of the mass burning process and ultimately tie ﬁrebrand production to a time-dependent heat-release rate for initialization of ﬁrebrand transport in numerical simulations. An average ﬁrebrand yield ranging from 3–4\% of initial dry mass is ultimately presented for lodgepole pine and Douglas ﬁr. Future work is required with larger fuel sizes pertaining to real wildﬁre scenarios; however, the presented methodology can provide valuable data needed to initialize numerical simulations of ﬁrebrand transport, necessary for reconstruction of {WUI} ﬁres and to aid in the development of mitigation strategies for the prevention of future disasters.},

Many experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of the firebrand attacks on structures and to identify possible solutions. The experimental facility consists of a firebrand generator coupled to a wind tunnel. The wind speed in the firebrand generator is relatively low, in order to assure a quality continuous flow of glowing firebrands. On the contrary, the wind speed in the wind tunnel is high to duplicate actual firebrand attacks. Previous works show a highly turbulent region above the entrance of firebrands to the wind tunnel which is formed because of the velocity difference and penetration of firebrand entrance hose into the wind tunnel. The penetration is required to provide a uniform firebrand distribution along the height of the test section. In this computational work, the influence of the height of the entrance hose, its orientation respect to the tunnel and the distance between the coupling port and the test section are analyzed. The optimized results are presented and discussed for a variety of wind speeds within the wind tunnel and the firebrand generator.},

In this study, in order to predict the scattering of firebrands in an urban fire, a computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}), turbulent combustion model, radiation model, and firebrand scattering model are coupled and it is validated by a fire wind tunnel experiment. The density, terminal velocity, and Stokes diameters of firebrands which are necessary for the firebrand scattering model are measured. The ratio of Stokes diameter to equivalent diameter is focused on 0.2–0.7. An urban fire simulation in a modeled urban area has been conducted using the coupled model and the firebrand experimental data. It is found that when the inflow wind velocity is comparatively slow, the size of the thermal plume becomes significant, and when the inflow wind velocity is high, the thermal plume is suppressed and greatly inclines to the leeward side, which increases the risk of the fire spreading to neighboring buildings. Firebrands can be scattered over 400 m. Firebrands are blown up by the thermal plume and the scattering distances are influenced by the background flow field, the magnitude of thermal plume, and the Stokes diameters of firebrands.},

Two unique features in this tunnel design set it aside from previous vertical wind tunnels: the vertical working section has a divergent taper that allows a ﬁrebrand to ﬁnd its terminal velocity within a velocity gradient, and the velocity of the boundary layer of the working section has been forced to a higher speed than the central zone to stop the ﬁrebrand impacting on the working section walls. These features in combination with a responsive speed control on the fan allow observation of burning ﬁrebrands throughout their viable lifetime in freefall with changing terminal velocities. This paper is intended as a synthesis of wind tunnel design and as a guide to researchers considering building similar devices to study the untethered ﬂight characteristics of local species of ﬁrebrands.},

The role of firebrands in fire propagation and the important parameters involved in spot fire development are studied. Historical large-scale fires, including wind-driven urban and wildland conflagrations and post-earthquake fires are given as examples. In addition, research on firebrand behaviour is reviewed. The phenomenon of spotting fires comprises three sequential mechanisms: generation, transport and ignition of recipient fuel. In order to understand these mechanisms, many experiments have been performed, such as measuring drag on firebrands, analysing the flow fields of flame and plume structures, collecting firebrands from burning materials, houses and wildfires, and observing firebrand burning characteristics in wind tunnels under the terminal velocity condition and ignition characteristics of fuel beds. The knowledge obtained from the experiments was used to develop firebrand models. Since Tarifa developed a firebrand model based on the terminal velocity approximation, many firebrand transport models have been developed to predict maximum spot fire distance. Combustion models of a firebrand were developed empirically and the maximum spot fire distance was found at the burnout limit. Recommendations for future research and development are provided.},

Trajectories modelled with and without the assumption that the firebrands’ relative velocities always equal their terminal velocities are. Various models for the flight and combustion of disc- and cylindrical-shaped firebrands are evaluated. Eight simulations are performed with surface fuel fires and four simulations are performed with combined surface and canopy fuels. Firebrand trajectories without terminal velocity are larger than those from models with terminal velocity. Discs travel further than cylinders, as discs are aerodynamically more favourable. Thin discs burning on their faces and tall cylinders burning around their circumference have shorter lifetimes than thin discs burning from their circumference or longer cylinders burning from their ends. Firebrands from canopy fires, with larger size and potential to ignite recipient fuel, travel further than firebrands from surface fires. In the simulations, which included a line fire ignition in homogeneous fuels on flat terrain, the firebrand launching patterns are very heterogeneous, and the trajectories and landing patterns are dominated by the coupled fire–atmosphere behaviour.},

	abstract = {Forest fire is a critical disaster that causes massive destruction of forest ecosystem and economic loss. Hence, accurate estimation of the burned area is important for evaluation of the degree of damage and for preparing baseline data for recovery. Since most of the area size damaged by wildfires in Korea is less than 1 ha, it is necessary to use satellite or drone images with a resolution of less than 10m for detecting the damage area. This paper aims to detect wildfire-damaged area from a Kompsat-3 image using the indices such as {NDVI} (normalized difference vegetation index) and {FBI} (fire burn index) and to examine the classification characteristics according to the methods such as Otsu thresholding and {ISODATA} (iterative self-organizing data analysis technique). To mitigate the salt-and-pepper phenomenon of the pixel-based classification, a gaussian filter was applied to the images of {NDVI} and {FBI}. Otsu thresholding and {ISODATA} could distinguish the burned forest from normal forest appropriately, and the salt-and-pepper phenomenon at the boundaries of burned forest was reduced by the gaussian filter. The result from {ISODATA} with gaussian filter using {NDVI} was closest to the official record of damage area (56.9 ha) published by the Korea Forest Service. Unlike Otsu thresholding for binary classification, since the {ISODATA} categorizes the images into multiple classes such as (1) severely burned area, (2) moderately burned area, (3) mixture of burned and unburned areas, and (4) unburned area, the characteristics of the boundaries consisting of burned and normal forests can be better expressed. It is expected that our approach can be utilized for the high-resolution images obtained from other satellites and drones.},

The study was carried out by physics based modeling where the wind flow turbulence was dealt with by large eddy simulation ({LES}) and firebrands were treated by Lagrangian tracking. The Lagrangian equations coupled with the flow solver, accounted for both translational and rotational motions as well as thermochemical degradation of firebrands, assumed to be cylindrical. The dimensions of the structure were varied from 3 to 9 m in the simulations for a parametric study. The simulations were carried out by tracking many firebrands randomly released with a uniform distribution from a horizontal plane 35 m above the ground into the computational domain. The coordinates of the deposited firebrands were used to calculate their normalized number density (number of landed firebrands per unit surface area) to quantify their deposition pattern. On the leewardside of the block, an area, referred to as the safe zone, was identified right behind the structure where firebrands never deposit. The size of the safe zone in the direction perpendicular to the wind was nearly identical to the width of the structure. The length of the safe zone in the wind direction was proportional to the height of the structure. The leeward face of the blocks was never hit by a firebrand. The windward face was hit by many more firebrands than the lateral faces but much less than the top face. The distribution of the number density of the deposited firebrands on the top face was found to be correlated with the flow separation and reattachment on this face.},

This ensured that firebrands would be quenched as soon as they made contact with the pans. The firebrands were subsequently dried and the sizes were measured using callipers and the dry mass was determined using a precision balance. For all experiments performed, the firebrands were cylindrical in shape. The average firebrand size measured from the 2.6-m Douglas-fir trees was 3 mm in diameter, 40 mm in length. The average firebrand size measured for the 5.2-m Douglas-fir trees was 4 mm in diameter with a length of 53 mm. The mass distribution of firebrands produced from two different tree sizes under similar tree moisture levels was similar. The only noticeable difference occurred in the largest mass class.

	abstract = {Several studies suggest that the ﬁrebrands are a major cause of structural ignition of Wildland–Urban Interface ﬁres in {USA} and Australia. For 40 years, past ﬁrebrand studies have focused on how far ﬁrebrands ﬂy and do not assess the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from ﬁrebrand showers. The development of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) Dragon has allowed the quantiﬁcation of structure ignition vulnerabilities of full-scale building assemblies. Full-scale tests are necessary to highlight vulnerabilities of structures to ignition under ﬁrebrand attack, whereas bench-scale test methods afford the capability to test new ﬁrebrand-resistant technologies and may serve as the basis for new standard testing methodologies. To this end, the present investigation was undertaken to construct a new and improved Dragon’s Lofting and Ignition Research facility. This entailed removing the {NIST} Baby Dragon from the wind tunnel facility and inserting the new and improved {NIST} continuous feed Baby Dragon. The unique feature of the continuous feed Baby Dragon, over the current {NIST} Baby Dragon, is the capability to produce a constant ﬁrebrand shower in order to expose building materials to continual ﬁrebrand bombardment. The efﬁcacy of the new experimental facility to determine ignition regime maps of building materials exposed to wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers is presented. Speciﬁcally, ignition regime maps are presented as a function of continuous ﬁrebrand generation rate, wind tunnel speed, and cedar moisture content. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Wind-driven firebrand showers are a major cause of structural ignition in Wildland-Urban Interface ({WUI}) fires. Past firebrand investigations have not been able to quantify the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from firebrand showers, as it is difficult to develop a measurement method to replicate wind-driven firebrand attack on structures that occur in actual {WUI} fires. To address this problem, research has been undertaken in an intricate area involving the quantification of structure vulnerabilities to wind-driven firebrand showers. This type of firebrand research has never been possible prior to the development of the {NIST} Firebrand Generator, also referred to as the {NIST} Dragon. Due the complexity of the {WUI} fire problem, great strides must be made to recruit the next generation of researchers to fire safety science from diverse backgrounds. This paper closes with a discussion of ongoing workshop activities intended to achieve this, as well as some challenges for future {WUI} fire research.},

	abstract = {Large outdoor fires have become commonplace all over the world. The International Organization for Standardization ({ISO}) defines large outdoor fires as an urban fire, tsunami-generated fire, volcano-generated fire, wildland-urban interface ({WUI}) fire, wildland fire, or informal settlement fire, where the total burnout area is significant. Perhaps of all the large outdoor fires, it is wildland fires that spread into urban areas, simply called {WUI} fires that attract the most attention. A glance at the recent headlines in the summer of 2022 reveals numerous catastrophic {WUI} fires all over Europe. Across the Atlantic Ocean in the {USA}, there is yet another destructive {WUI} fire raging in the {USA} state of California. With the increasing risks from a changing climate, these large outdoor fire disasters are only going to become more and more commonplace all over the world. More homes will be lost and more lives will be lost. It is the authors opinion that a targeted, multi-disciplinary approach is needed to address the large outdoor fire problem. In this short, invited paper to
              Horizons in Mechanical Engineering
              , it is argued that large outdoor fire problem is a fascinating and challenging research area and that engineers have the necessary skills and training to impact a problem that influences millions upon millions of people all over the world. An important danger, present in all large outdoor fires, are firebrands. Firebrands are introduced for non-specialist readers, and the most recent literature is reviewed. Several challenges are discussed, in particular, areas where engineers may help move the needle forward on this globally important topic.},

	abstract = {The probability of structural ignition is dependent both on physical properties of materials and the ﬁre exposure conditions. In this study, the effect of ﬁrebrand characteristics (i.e., ﬁrebrand size, number of ﬁrebrands) on wood ignition behavior was considered. Mathematical modeling and laboratory experiment were conducted to better understand the conditions of wood ignition by a single or group of ﬁrebrands with different geometry. This model considers the heat exchange between the ﬁrebrands, wood layer and the gas phase, moisture evaporation in the ﬁrebrands and the diffusion gases of water vapor in the pyrolysis zone. In order to test and verify the model, a series of experiments to determine probability and conditions for ignition of wood-based materials (plywood, oriented strand board, chipboard) caused by wildland ﬁrebrands (pine twigs with a diameter of 6–8 mm and a length of 40 ± 2 mm) were conducted. The experiments investigated the ﬁrebrand impact on the wood layer under different parameters, such as ﬁrebrand size and quantity, wind speed, and type of wood. The results of experiments showed that the increase in wind speed leads to the increase in probability of wood ignition. Based on the received results, it can be concluded that the ignition curve of wood samples by ﬁrebrands is nonlinear and depends on the wind speed and ﬁrebrand size as well as their quantity. At the same time, there is no ignition of wood samples in the range of wind speed of 0–1 m/s. The ignition of wood is possible with a decrease in the distance between the ﬁrebrands with a decrease in the ﬁrebrand length. This result agrees more closely with the model.},

In the United States, the {WUI} accounts for a significant portion of wildland fire suppression and wildland fuel treatment costs. Methods to reduce structure losses are focussed on fuel treatments in either wildland fuels or residential fuels. There is a need for a well-characterised, systematic testing of these approaches across a range of community and structure types and fire conditions. Laboratory experiments, field measurements and fire behaviour models can be used to better determine the exposure conditions faced by communities and structures. The outcome of such an effort would be proven fuel treatment techniques for wildland and residential fuels, risk assessment strategies, economic cost analysis models, and test methods with representative exposure conditions for fire-resistant building designs and materials.},

In one, experimental measurements of non-burning cylindrical particles falling in still air are compared to numerical predictions and in the other, predictions of time-evolution of mass and size of stationary burning particles in air flows are compared with experimental results reported in the literature. Results yielded by the proposed models for a demonstration problem involving cylindrical winddriven firebrands, with the same initial volume, mass and position, but different initial aspect ratios and distinct initial orientations relative to the wind velocity, are then presented. These results show the following: the horizontal distance travelled by the firebrand from release to landing locations is an increasing function of its initial aspect ratio; and the initial orientation of the firebrand, and its subsequent oscillations including possible rotation, have a significant influence on its trajectory, thus it is important to account for them in mathematical models formulated for predicting the spread of fires by spotting.},

This work is devoted to the development of new algorithms and their testing and, as such, several laboratory experiments were conducted. Wood pellets, bark, and twigs of pine were used to generate ﬁrebrands. An infrared camera ({JADE} J530SB) was used to obtain the necessary thermal video ﬁles. The thermograms were then processed to create an annotated {IR} video database that was used to test both the detector and the tracker. Following these studies, the analysis showed that the Diﬀerence of Gaussians detection algorithm and the Hungarian tracking algorithm upheld the highest level of accuracy and were the easiest to implement. The study also indicated that further development of detection and tracking algorithms using the current approach will not signiﬁcantly improve their accuracy. As such, convolutional neural networks hold high potential to be used as an alternative approach.},

In this study, we conduct experiments in a wind tunnel to investigate the eﬀect of wind on the smouldering burning and transport of ﬁrebrands. Three diﬀerent sizes of disc wood particles (weighing about 1 g) are heated to generate smouldering ﬁrebrands, and then blown out by a horizontal wind of 5 or 7 m/s. In each experiment the transport distance (in the order of 1 m) and mass loss of ﬁrebrands are measured to examine their burning behaviours. For the ﬁrst time, a bimodal distribution (burning and extinction modals) is observed for small ﬁrebrands under certain wind speeds (ﬁrebrands of 12-mm diameter and 5-mm thickness under a wind speed of 7 m/s in this work). Both the ﬁrebrand transport distance and mass loss in the extinction modal are smaller than those in the burning modal. The heat transfer analysis shows that there is a critical wind speed to quench the ﬁrebrand and produce a bimodal distribution, and its value increases with both the particle size and the heating duration. The predicted critical wind speed agrees well with experimental measurements.},

	abstract = {Spotting during wildﬁres can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the way wildﬁres spread and reduce the chances of successful containment by ﬁre crews. However, there is little published empirical evidence of the phenomenon. In this study, we have analysed spotting patterns observed from 251 wildﬁres from a database of over 8000 aerial line scan images capturing active wildﬁre across mainland southeast Australia between 2002 and 2018. The images were used to measure spot ﬁre numbers, number of “long-distance” spot ﬁres ({\textgreater} 500 m), and maximum spotting distance. We describe three types of spotting distance distributions, compare patterns among diﬀerent regions of southeast Australia, and associate these with broad measures of rainfall, elevation, and fuel type. We found a relatively high correlation between spotting distance and numbers; however, there were also several cases of wildﬁres with low spot ﬁre numbers producing very long-distance spot ﬁres. Most long-distance spotting was associated with a “multi-modal” distribution type, where high numbers of spot ﬁres ignite close to the source ﬁre and isolated or small clumps of spot ﬁres ignite at longer distances. The multi-modal distribution suggests that current models of spotting distance, which typically follow an exponential-shaped distribution, could underestimate long-distance spotting. We also found considerable regional variation in spotting phenomena that may be associated with signiﬁcant variation in rainfall, topographic ruggedness, and fuel descriptors. East Victoria was the most spot-ﬁre-prone of the regions, particularly in terms of long-distance spotting.},

This version of the Firebrand Generator is based upon the {NIST} Dragon, the only experimental device capable of generating controlled firebrand showers. The unique features of the continuous feed Baby Dragon, as opposed to the present {NIST} Dragon, is the capability to produce a constant firebrand shower in order to expose building materials to continual firebrand bombardment. An experimental series was conducted to determine the range of operating conditions for this device. Wood pieces were fed into the device using a conveyer system, ignited using a propane burner, and a blower was used to loft the generated firebrands. The number flux and mass flux were measured as a function of feeding rate to determine optimum conditions to generate steady firebrand showers. It was observed that a feeding rate of 15 pieces (34.6 g/min) provided the most constant and uniform continuous firebrand production. Measurements of heat release rate ({HRR}) were conducted to make sure the device provided low {HRR} in order to determine if it may be considered for use by testing laboratories in a safe manner. Finally, the firebrand size and mass produced using the newly developed device presented in this paper are commensurate to those measured from full-scale tree burns and actual {WUI} fires.},

As a result, a series of experiments were conducted to examine ignition of wood fencing assemblies subjected to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers. Western Red Cedar and Redwood fencing assemblies were exposed to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrands generated by the {NIST} full-scale Continuous Feed Firebrand Generator installed in the Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility at the Building Research Institute in Japan. To simulate ﬁne fuels that may be present near fencing assemblies, dried shredded hardwood mulch beds were placed adjacent to the fencing assemblies. The fencing assemblies were varied in length and in orientation to the applied wind ﬁeld to simulate a range of conﬁgurations that may be encountered in realistic situations. Both ﬂat and corner sections of fencing assemblies were used in these experiments. The dimensions of the ﬂat wood fencing assemblies sections were varied from 0.91 m wide, 1.83 m in height to 1.83 m wide, 1.83 m in height. With respect to the corner sections, the dimensions used were 0.91 m by 0.91 m by 1.83 m in height. All conﬁgurations considered resulted in ﬂaming ignition ({FI}) of the mulch beds, and subsequent {FI} of the wood fencing assemblies. Finally, experiments were also completed to determine if wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers could produce {FI} of fencing assemblies without the presence of ﬁne fuels adjacent to the fence sections. Firebrands produced smoldering ignition ({SI}) of the fencing assemblies without ﬁne fuels present, and {SI} transitioned to {FI} under the applied wind ﬁeld. These experiments have demonstrated that wood fencing assemblies are vulnerable to ignition by wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers.},

Many past investigations have focused on singular eﬀects on ﬁre spread, and little is known about coupled eﬀects. The coupled eﬀect of radiative heat ﬂux and ﬁrebrand showers on ignition processes of fuel beds is studied by using a newly developed experimental protocol. The newly developed protocol includes the addition of a radiant panel to the existing experimental setup of a ﬁrebrand generator coupled to a wind facility. Experiments were performed under an applied wind ﬁeld, as the wind is a key parameter in large outdoor ﬁre spread processes.

	abstract = {The combustion of various fuels results in the release of firebrands during wildland-urban interface ({WUI}) fires. Firebrands represent a hazard, since the release of firebrands may lead to multiple ignitions at locations distant from the original combustion source. A newly devel­ oped experimental protocol using a non-reacting heater was used to simulate a firebrand. A direct comparison of this simplified non-reacting heater setup was undertaken to realistic fuel bed ignition to actual firebrand showers. Firebrand showers were generated using a custom experimental setup developed for this investigation. The novelty of this research is a detailed comparison for the first time to fuel bed ignition from non-reacting heaters to actual firebrand showers, for the same fuel bed type. The focus here is on smoldering ignition ({SI}) of the fuel beds, as this is seen as a complex and least understood aspect of firebrand ignition of actual {WUI} fires. Results indicate that the overall phenomen­ ology of the ignition process is different between a non-reacting car­ tridge heater and a shower of firebrands. Complicated smoldering ignition phenomena of fuel beds by firebrand showers cannot be simu­ lated by a simple non-reacting heater.},

	abstract = {Firebrand spotting is a potential threat to people and infrastructure, which is difﬁcult to predict and becomes more signiﬁcant when the size of a ﬁre and intensity increases. To conduct realistic physics-based modeling with ﬁrebrand transport, the ﬁrebrand generation data such as numbers, size, and shape of the ﬁrebrands are needed. Broadly, the ﬁrebrand generation depends on atmospheric conditions, wind velocity and vegetation species. However, there is no experimental study that has considered all these factors although they are available separately in some experimental studies. Moreover, the experimental studies have ﬁrebrand collection data, not generation data. In this study, we have conducted a series of physics-based simulations on a trial-and-error basis to reproduce the experimental collection data, which is called an inverse analysis. Once the generation data was determined from the simulation, we applied the interpolation technique to calibrate the effects of wind velocity, relative humidity, and vegetation species. First, we simulated Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) tree-burning and quantiﬁed ﬁrebrand generation against the tree burning experiment conducted at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}). Then, we applied the same technique to a prescribed forest ﬁre experiment conducted in the Pinelands National Reserve ({PNR}) of New Jersey, the {USA}. The simulations were conducted with the experimental data of fuel load, humidity, temperature, and wind velocity to ensure that the ﬁeld conditions are replicated in the experiments. The ﬁrebrand generation rate was found to be 3.22 pcs/{MW}/s (pcs-number of ﬁrebrands pieces) from the single tree burning and 4.18 pcs/{MW}/s in the forest ﬁre model. This ﬁnding was complemented with the effects of wind, vegetation type, and fuel moisture content to quantify the ﬁrebrand generation rate.},

This paper presents an experimental and modelling study on the flaming and smouldering burning of wood firebrands under forced convection. Methods. The firebrand burning experiments were conducted with different wind speeds and firebrand sizes. Key results. The burning rate of firebrands under forced convection is quantified by wood pyrolysis rate, char oxidation rate and a convective term. The firebrand projected area is correlated with firebrand diameter, char density, wind speed, and flaming or smouldering burning. A surface temperature model is derived in terms of condensed-phase energy conservation. We finally establish a simplified firebrand transport model based on the burning rate, projected area and surface temperature of firebrands. Conclusion. The mass loss due to wood pyrolysis is much greater than that due to char oxidation in self-sustaining burning. The burning rate is proportional to U1/2, where U is wind speed. The projected area for flaming firebrands decreases more rapidly than that for smouldering ones. The firebrand surface temperature is mainly determined by radiation. Implications. Knowledge about firebrand burning characteristics is essential for predicting the flight distance and trajectory in firebrand transport.},

	abstract = {A new instrument to quantify ﬁrebrand dynamics during ﬁres with particular focus on those associated with the Wildland-Urban Interface ({WUI}) has been developed. During {WUI} ﬁres, ﬁrebrands can ignite spot ﬁres, which can rapidly increase the rate of spread ({ROS}) of the ﬁre, provide a mechanism by which the ﬁre can pass over ﬁrebreaks and are the leading cause of structure ignitions. Despite this key role in driving wildﬁre dynamics and hazards, diﬃculties in collecting ﬁrebrands in the ﬁeld and preserving their physical condition (e.g. dimensions and temperature) have limited the development of knowledge of ﬁrebrand dynamics. In this work we present a new, ﬁeld-deployable diagnostic tool, an emberometer, designed to provide measurement of ﬁrebrand ﬂuxes and information on both the geometry and the thermal conditions of ﬁrebrands immediately before deposition by combining a visual and infrared camera. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to calibrate and validate the developed imaging techniques. The emberometer was then deployed in the ﬁeld to explore ﬁrebrand ﬂuxes and particle conditions for a range of ﬁre intensities in natural pine forest environments. In addition to ﬁrebrand particle characterization, ﬁeld observations with the emberometer enabled detailed time history of deposition (i.e. ﬁrebrand ﬂux) relative to concurrent in situ ﬁre behaviour observations. We highlight that deposition was characterised by intense, short duration ‘‘showers’’ that can be reasonably associated to spikes in the average ﬁre line intensity. The results presented illustrate the potential use of an emberometer in studying ﬁrebrand and spot ﬁre dynamics.},

Back substrate temperature, combustion heat release rate, modified combustion efficiency, and gaseous flame ignition and extinction statistics were collected. For a firebrand pile covering 5 × 10 cm2 area of the {WRC} substrate at 0.16 g cm− 2 density, the probability of the substrate ignition increased from 11 to 55\% with the air flow velocity increasing from 0.9 to 2.4 m s− 1. The probability decreased upon further increase in the air flow. At 2.4 m s− 1, the probability of the substrate ignition decreased to 11\% when the firebrand coverage density was reduced to 0.06 g cm− 2. Qualitatively similar trends were observed for the maximum Kaowool {PM} back surface temperature and peak heat release rate. The {WRC}’s maximum contribution to the combustion heat release rate was found to be {\textless} 12\% of the maximum contribution of the firebrand pile. Almost all {WRC} surface ignitions were observed to occur at the air flow facing edge of the firebrand pile.

	abstract = {The increasing occurrence of severe wildﬁres, coupled with the expansion of the wildland urban interface has increased the number of structures in danger of being destroyed by wildﬁres. Ignition by ﬁrebrands is a signiﬁcant avenue for ﬁre spread and structure loss; thus, understanding processes and parameters that control the ignition of fuel beds by ﬁrebrands is important for reducing these losses. In this study the effect of fuel bed characteristics (i.e., particle size and porous or solid fuel bed) on ignition behavior was considered. Modelling and analysis was conducted to better understand parameters that are dominant in controlling ignition. The fuel beds, made from Douglas-ﬁr shavings, Douglas-ﬁr plates, or cardboard plates, were heated with a cartridge heater (i.e., surrogate ﬁrebrand) to observe ignition. Smaller particles were observed to ignite more readily in porous beds than larger particles when heat transfer from the heater is primarily through conduction. This occurs in large part due to differences in contact area between the fuel bed and the heater coupled with thermal properties of the fuel bed. As particle sizes increased, ignition was more likely to occur at extended times ({\textgreater}100 s) due to the increased importance of radiation heat transfer. Douglas-ﬁr plates were primarily observed to ignite at times where conduction was the dominant mode of heat transfer ({\textless}10 s). Heat ﬂux delivered to the fuel bed was observed to be a more accurate predictor of ignition likelihood and ignition time than heater temperatures. The characteristic ratio of transport and chemical timescales can be used, in conjunction with the measured heat ﬂux and thermal diffusivity of the fuel beds, as a ﬁrst approximation to predict ignition for the porous fuel beds. This suggests that future work focusing on these parameters may produce a general characterization of fuel bed ignition probability across fuel beds materials and morphologies.},

The ambient wind plays an important role in smouldering ignition of wildland fuels by ﬁrebrands, but its inﬂuence is poorly stated. In this work, the eﬀect of ambient wind on the ignition of a moist pine needle fuel bed by a glowing ﬁrebrand was investigated. Two ignition outcomes, smouldering or failed ignition, were observed. Wind was found to have a signiﬁcant impact on the ignition process by aﬀecting the glowing combustion state of the ﬁrebrand. As the wind velocity increased from zero to 4 m/s, the smouldering ignition probability ﬁrstly increased and then decreased, while the smouldering ignition delay time decreased. Under the same wind conditions, the ignition probability decreased while the smouldering ignition delay time increased as the fuel moisture content increased from 5.9\% to 53.2\%. A theoretical model based on the glowing combustion rate of ﬁrebrand and heat transfer between the ﬁrebrand and the fuel bed under the eﬀect of wind was proposed. The model predicted the variation trend of the smoldering ignition delay time with the wind velocity well when {FMC} was less than 20\%, but poor at higher {FMC}. It also predicted that the square root of ignition delay time had a good linear relationship with {FMC}. This work is a step forward in understanding of spot ﬁres initiated by glowing ﬁrebrands.},

The technical description of the {TSC} design and a formulation of the proposed calibration technique are presented.

The proposed calibration methodology is designed to account for uncertainties inherent to the simplicity of the irradiation measurement technique, therefore not requiring precise information regarding material thermal and optical properties. This methodology is designed and presented so as to enable adaption of the technique to meet the speciﬁc requirements of other experimental setups.

One of the areas of wild fires monitoring is the evaluation of forest wild fires spreading ability to transportation of firebrands by the wind. This way observed at crown-type of forest wild fires, which are formed from ground ones by transferring the flame to the trees crowns when the wind reaches a certain speed. A mathematical model has been developed for the firebrands transportation by the wind. Mathematical model adequacy was evaluated by inclusion of transfer coefficient as a ratio of firebrand speed to wind speed. The modeling of the horizontal firebrands transportation (sphere, cylinder and disc) has been carried out. Experimental conditions are firebrands have various sizes, fall off from a height of 5-20 m, at a wind speed of 1-5 m∙s-1. Spherical and discshaped particles have the best transportation ability. The adequacy of the model of horizontal firebrands transportation has been experimentally proved by conducting our own experiments and analyzing information obtained from the literature on similar studies. The results of the experiments showed that with an increase in the air flow speed up to 10 m∙s-1, the speed of the burning particle does not exceed the speed of the air flow that stimulates it. Thus, it is shown that within the air flow velocity of 1-10 m∙s-1, the value of the transfer coefficient does not exceed one.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new set of probabilistic joint shear strength models using the conventional multiple linear regression method, and advanced machine-learning methods of multivariate adaptive regression splines ({MARS}) and symbolic regression ({SR}). In order to achieve high-ﬁdelity regression models with reduced model errors and bias, this study constructs extensive experimental databases for reinforced and unreinforced concrete joints by collecting existing beam-column joint subassemblage tests from multiple sources. Various inﬂuential parameters that affect joint shear strength such as material properties, design parameters, and joint conﬁguration are investigated through tests of statistical signiﬁcance. After performing a set of regression analyses, the comparison of simulation results indicates that {MARS} approach is the best estimation method. Moreover, the accuracy of analytical predictions of the derived {MARS} model is compared with that of existing joint shear strength relationships. The comparison results show that the proposed model is more accurate compared to existing relationships. This joint shear strength prediction model can be readily implemented into joint response models for evaluation of earthquake performance and inelastic responses of building frames.

Flame structure, local gas temperature as well as local soot volume fraction and primary soot particle diameter, are simultaneously detected by means of {OH} planar laser-induced fluorescence ({PLIF}), non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence ({nTLAF}) of indium, and time-resolved ({TiRe}) laser-induced incandescence ({LII}), respectively. The collected data sets were used to generate joint statistics of soot properties and flame characteristics and provided new insights into the interaction of the {OH} layer and soot in turbulent flames. The interaction of {OH} and soot as a driving mechanism for soot oxidation is of particular interest as it has been proven to be challenging to model. Statistics of soot volume fraction and primary particle size in the {OH} layer are employed to gain deeper insights into the soot oxidation process. Mean soot volume fraction and primary soot particle size conditioned on temperature and {OH} signal intensity indicate that, due to differential diffusion of soot with respect to the chemical species, high soot volume fraction and primary soot particle diameter of up to 50 nm are present at low temperatures and low {OH} concentration. In the soot oxidation region, statistical analysis of the soot parameters disclose that clusters of high soot volume fraction mostly consist of large primary particles. Observations from instantaneous images and the presence of large primary particles inside the {OH} layer suggest that the oxidation is not sufficiently fast to burn the soot completely.},

	abstract = {Spotting ignition by firebrands is a significant fire spread pathway at the wildland-urban interface ({WUI}), where mulch products are commonly used as landscaping materials. Mulch is typically organic in nature, thus it may be easily ignited into a smoldering mode by firebrands and subsequently transition to flaming, leading to direct flame contact and radiant heat exposure to siding materials of adjacent structures. This work quantified the thresholds of smoldering ignition of four common types of commercially available mulch (black mulch ({BM}), forest floor ({FF}), redwood ({RW}), and fir bark ({FB})) exposed to heating by smoldering firebrand piles, and their propensity for smoldering-to-flaming transition under external winds (up to 1.4 m/s). We found that there was a minimum mass of firebrand pile to achieve smoldering ignition of mulch (e.g., {\textasciitilde}0.1 g for {FF}). Beyond this minimum mass, the required wind speed to trigger smoldering ignition generally decreased as the mass of the firebrand pile increased, agreeing well with theoretical analysis. After smoldering ignition, smoldering-toflaming transition could be observed when the wind speed exceeded a critical value (e.g., {\textasciitilde}1 m/s for {FF}), which was not affected by the initial spotting process. To achieve smoldering-to-flaming transition, the glowing mulch had to reach a critical temperature of around 850 ◦C. Mulch samples with larger particle sizes were more likely to smolder and transition to flaming, due to increased oxygen supply through larger inter-particle pores and channels and better firebrand accumulation due to a more crevice-like geometry on the fuel surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of the ignition and burning behavior of landscaping mulches, and thus contributes to the prevention of extreme {WUI} fire events.},

The ignition threat of firebrand exposures can be characterized by measuring the heat transfer of glowing firebrands to a surface. The current study presents a novel method for conducting time-resolved heat transfer measurements from individual firebrands across a range of flow conditions. Experiments are conducted with individual glowing firebrands generated from birch discs and placed on a copper thin skin calorimeter of the same diameter, which is embedded in the substrate. The net heat flux from the firebrand to the thin skin calorimeter is obtained from the thermal energy storage in the thin skin calorimeter, plus heat conduction losses to the substrate. Values of peak net heat flux, total heating, duration of heating are reported under different flow conditions from 0.05 m/s to 1.6 m/s. The average peak net heat flux for the disc-shaped birch firebrands is 45 {kW}/m2, and does not change significantly with flow condition. However, there is an increase in the total heating, duration of heating, and total mass consumed as the flow velocity increases.},

	abstract = {Burning embers, commonly called ﬁrebrands, are lofted by a ﬁre’s buoyant plume and transported downwind to ignite new ﬁres (spot ﬁres) ahead of the main ﬁre. In the present work, transport and combustion of ﬁrebrands from burning trees are numerically investigated. A three-dimensional physics-based model is used to precompute the steady-state gas ﬂow and thermal ﬁelds induced by a crown ﬁre into which ﬁrebrands will be injected. Another preliminary study of the thermal degradation and combustion of woody fuel particles is conducted to determine the burning characteristics of ﬁrebrands. Then the trajectories and burning rates of disk-shaped ﬁrebrands lofted by the crown ﬁre plume and transported downwind are calculated for various values of the wind speed, Uwind, and of the ﬁre intensity, I . Firebrands of different sizes and densities are ﬁrst launched from a speciﬁed location at the top of the canopy. Firebrands that fall on the ground are in a ﬂaming or a glowing state depending on the product ρfw0 × τ (ρfw0 : initial ﬁrebrand density, τ : ﬁrebrand thickness). Results show that for ﬁrebrands that remain longer in the thermal plume, the distance covered upon landing is independent of the initial particle diameter and correlates well with I 0.1Uw0.i9nd(ρfw0 × τ )−0.2. The normalized brand mass fraction at landing also correlates with the ﬂight time normalized by the product ρfw0 × τ for ﬂaming ﬁrebrands or by the product ρfw0 × D05/3 (D0: initial ﬁrebrand diameter) for glowing ﬁrebrands. For ﬁrebrands released from random locations within the canopy, the above correlations remain unchanged, thereby demonstrating the generality of the developed approach.},

To develop predictive tools to evaluate this hazard, it is necessary to understand the conditions that govern firebrand generation and those that affect firebrand deposition. A method is presented that allows for time-resolved measurements of fire behavior to be related to the dynamics of firebrand deposition. Firebrand dynamics were recorded in three fires undertaken in two different ecosystems. Fire intensity is shown to drive firebrand generation and firebrand deposition—higher global fire intensities resulting in the deposition of more, larger firebrands at a given distance from the fire front. Local firebrand dynamics are also shown to dominate the temporal firebrand deposition with periods of high fire intensity within a fire resulting in firebrand shower at deposition sites at times commensurate with firebrand transport. For the range of conditions studied, firebrand deposition can be expected up to 200 m ahead of the fire line based on extrapolation from the measurements.},

Firebrands allow for the eﬃcient breaching across fuel-free barriers such as roads, rivers and constructed fuel breaks. Existing observation-based knowledge on medium-distance ﬁrebrand travel is often based on single tree experiments that do not replicate the intensity and convective updraft of a continuous crown ﬁre. Recent advances in acoustic analysis, speciﬁcally pattern detection, has enabled the quantiﬁcation of the rate at which ﬁrebrands are observed in the audio recordings of in-ﬁre cameras housed within ﬁre-proof steel boxes that have been deployed on experimental ﬁres. The audio pattern being detected is the sound created by a ﬂying ﬁrebrand hitting the steel box of the camera. This technique allows for the number of ﬁrebrands per second to be quantiﬁed and can be related to the ﬁre’s location at that same time interval (using a detailed rate of spread reconstruction) in order to determine the ﬁrebrand travel distance. A proof of concept is given for an experimental crown ﬁre that shows the viability of this technique. When related to the ﬁre’s location, key areas of medium-distance spotting are observed that correspond to regions of peak ﬁre intensity. Trends on the number of ﬁrebrands landing per square metre as the ﬁre approaches are readily quantiﬁed using low-cost instrumentation.},

A parametric study showed that the porosity, heat of reaction, and oxygen concentration were the most influential parameters on the ember combustion. Then, the model was compared to a series of bench-scale experiments in terms of glowing time and thermal response of a nonreacting substrate when exposed to a hot ember. The simulation results showed that ember combustion was mostly diffusion-controlled rather than kinetic-controlled. Thus, given the ember diversities in spotting fire, modelers should pay more attention to the difference in the physical properties instead of the kinetics between ember species.},

            Wildfires burn millions of hectares per year on every inhabited continent, but the physical mechanism governing spread is not known. Models of wildfire spread are widely used for prediction, firefighter training, and ecological research but have assumed various formulations of known heat transfer processes (radiation and convection) absent a definitive theory of their organization. New experimental evidence reported here reveals how buoyancy generated by the fire induces vorticity and instabilities in the flame zone that control the convective heating needed to ignite fuel particles and produce spread.
          ,
            Large wildfires of increasing frequency and severity threaten local populations and natural resources and contribute carbon emissions into the earth-climate system. Although wildfires have been researched and modeled for decades, no verifiable physical theory of spread is available to form the basis for the precise predictions needed to manage fires more effectively and reduce their environmental, economic, ecological, and climate impacts. Here, we report new experiments conducted at multiple scales that appear to reveal how wildfire spread derives from the tight coupling between flame dynamics induced by buoyancy and fine-particle response to convection. Convective cooling of the fine-sized fuel particles in wildland vegetation is observed to efficiently offset heating by thermal radiation until convective heating by contact with flames and hot gasses occurs. The structure and intermittency of flames that ignite fuel particles were found to correlate with instabilities induced by the strong buoyancy of the flame zone itself. Discovery that ignition in wildfires is critically dependent on nonsteady flame convection governed by buoyant and inertial interaction advances both theory and the physical basis for practical modeling.},

It is often pyrolysis and combustion products that cause deaths from fires in closed spaces. Fire sprinkler system activation does not always lead to efficient smoke deposition. Sometimes, a fire sup­ pression liquid supply, on the contrary, deteriorates fire evacuation conditions. The study of smoke gen­ eration and deposition characteristics is an essential prerequisite for improving rescue technologies during fires. The purpose of this research was to define the characteristics of deposition of solid combustion product particles of a group of typical construction and finishing materials in closed spaces: wood, lino­ leum, rubber, etc. Solid particles (pyrolysis products) have been distributed by size and concentration. The smoke generation and extinction coefficients, as well as deposition rates of smoke aerosol particles with and without using water aerosol have been determined. The ranges of optical properties of smoke aerosol have been specified. The time of dispersed water impact on smoke aerosol was varied to evaluate its effect on the mass rate of deposition of solid combustion product particles. The characteristics of absorption of laser radiation with different wavelengths in flue gases have been defined to identify the most advanta­ geous colors of reflector materials used to manufacture direction signs for the evacuation of people from the combustion zone.},

Speciﬁcally, this ﬁre broke out from a Chinese restaurant in Itoigawa-city, Niigata, Japan on December 22nd 2016. On the day of the ﬁre, strong winds resulted in rapid ﬁre spread. With the presence of an average wind speed of 9 m/s, the ﬁre quickly spread, resulting in the damage of 147 structures, with 120 of 147 destroyed. The ﬁre was extinguished more than 30 h later. During the ﬁre, ﬁrebrands were observed and 10 spot ﬁres were reported. After the ﬁre, investigations were performed and ﬁrebrands were collected from the burn site. The size and the mass of ﬁrebrands were measured and compared with the available literature data. It was observed that more than 60\% of the collected ﬁrebrands had less than 0.10 g mass and 2.0 cm2 projected area and the size and the mass of ﬁrebrands were independent of the location. The size and the mass of ﬁrebrands from this ﬁre were similar to those from another urban ﬁre under similar wind speed and were also compared to those produced from a ﬁrebrand generator. The ﬁrebrand data set presented here provided valuable insights into how ﬁrebrands are generated from structures in actual urban ﬁres. Finally, the description on how a ﬁrebrand generator may be used to produce ﬁrebrands similar to urban ﬁres yields an important advancement to begin to study such complex phenomena in the laboratory.},

As part of an ongoing eﬀort to improve the understanding of wildﬁre spread and provide useful tools for ﬁre management, an image-based diagnostic system is being developed for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the turbulent ﬂame in the ﬁeld. The method allows the time-resolved measurement of the geometric ﬂame features (height, surface area and volume). This paper presents the application of two synchronized stereovision systems to static line of ﬁre scenarios. Each stereovision system, with 1 m inter-camera distance, was located at 12 m from the ﬁre and captured complementary images from front and rear views. Dual spectral band (visible-{NIR}) cameras were used to enhance ﬁre pixel detection. A series of experiments were carried out on 5 m long and 2 m wide beds of excelsior in the open with fuel loads of 2, 4 and 8 kg/m2. The maximum ﬂame heights were in the range of 1.2–2.4 m. Measurement of the heat ﬂux densities was performed at several positions using thermopiletype sensors. Peak heat ﬂuxes of 6.4–15.7 {kW}/m2 were measured at 3 m from the ﬁre. The thermal radiation impinging ahead of the ﬂame front was characterized according to its geometric properties. The results exhibit not only a linear relationship between the ﬂame volume and radiant heat ﬂux but also high correlations between their temporal ﬂuctuations. The image processing technique enables measurements of ﬂame volume to be a reliable substitute for the usual ﬁre thermal properties.},

	abstract = {Several studies suggest that the ﬁrebrands are a major cause of structural ignition of Wildland–Urban Interface ﬁres in {USA} and Australia. For 40 years, past ﬁrebrand studies have focused on how far ﬁrebrands ﬂy and do not assess the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from ﬁrebrand showers. The development of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) Dragon has allowed the quantiﬁcation of structure ignition vulnerabilities of full-scale building assemblies. Full-scale tests are necessary to highlight vulnerabilities of structures to ignition under ﬁrebrand attack, whereas bench-scale test methods afford the capability to test new ﬁrebrand-resistant technologies and may serve as the basis for new standard testing methodologies. To this end, the present investigation was undertaken to construct a new and improved Dragon’s Lofting and Ignition Research facility. This entailed removing the {NIST} Baby Dragon from the wind tunnel facility and inserting the new and improved {NIST} continuous feed Baby Dragon. The unique feature of the continuous feed Baby Dragon, over the current {NIST} Baby Dragon, is the capability to produce a constant ﬁrebrand shower in order to expose building materials to continual ﬁrebrand bombardment. The efﬁcacy of the new experimental facility to determine ignition regime maps of building materials exposed to wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers is presented. Speciﬁcally, ignition regime maps are presented as a function of continuous ﬁrebrand generation rate, wind tunnel speed, and cedar moisture content. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Tests in an oven (uncontrolled ambient composition, imposed ambient temperature) were ﬁrst carried out to screen the effect of different parameters, including particle size, amount of material, moisture content, material compaction, heating rate, and storage geometry, on the onset and development of smouldering. The thermal ignition of pine bark was observed starting from 190 °C. Experiments carried out in a ﬂow tubular reactor (imposed ambient temperature and composition) were also carried out. The main produced gases analyzed under different ignition conditions, and concentrations of {CO}, {CO}2, H2 and O2 were measured and discussed. The ﬂow results indicated that pine bark evolves into smouldering supported by a minimum oxygen concentration, at low enough ﬂuxes to limit the material cooling due to convection. Finally, the ratio {CO}/{CO}2 monitored identiﬁes different oxidation stages during the smouldering process.},

Furthermore, pyrolysis and combustion are increasingly utilized to dispose of solid wastes and convert them into value-added fuels. To better understand the pyrolysis and combustion characteristics of these materials, typical thermal insulation materials (expanded polystyrene ({EPS}) and extruded polystyrene ({XPS})) were investigated by employing thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry as well as cone calorimetry experiments. Pyrolysis behavior, kinetic parameters, pyrolysis index, thermodynamic parameters, endothermic properties and combustion parameters were estimated comprehensively. The results showed that {EPS} had better pyrolysis properties, while {XPS} had better combustion characteristics. Activation energies of {EPS} and {XPS} were 158.82 {kJ}/mol and 200.70 {kJ}/ mol, respectively. Additionally, {EPS} had a higher pyrolysis stability index and comprehensive pyrolysis index, meaning a more intense reaction. Moreover, thermodynamic parameters indicated that the devolatilization products could be obtained easily from the two materials, and {EPS} and {XPS} could be converted into fuels. For the combustion, {XPS} had a smaller ﬁre performance index and a larger ﬁre growth index. These results can guide the reactor design and optimization for better converting polymer wastes into fuels and managing wastes.},

Tree models are represented as connected particles for the branching structure and a polygonal surface mesh for the combustion. Each particle stores biological and physical attributes that drive the kinetic behavior of a plant and the exothermic reaction of the combustion. Coupled with realistic physics for rods, the particles enable dynamic branch motions. We model material properties, such as moisture and charring behavior, and associate them with individual particles. The combustion is efficiently processed in the surface domain of the tree model on a polygonal mesh. A user can dynamically interact with the model by initiating fires and by inducing stress on branches. The flames realistically propagate through the tree model by consuming the available resources. Our method runs at interactive rates and supports multiple tree instances in parallel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerous examples and evaluate its plausibility against the combustion of real wood samples.},

In the United States, the {WUI} accounts for a significant portion of wildland fire suppression and wildland fuel treatment costs. Methods to reduce structure losses are focussed on fuel treatments in either wildland fuels or residential fuels. There is a need for a well-characterised, systematic testing of these approaches across a range of community and structure types and fire conditions. Laboratory experiments, field measurements and fire behaviour models can be used to better determine the exposure conditions faced by communities and structures. The outcome of such an effort would be proven fuel treatment techniques for wildland and residential fuels, risk assessment strategies, economic cost analysis models, and test methods with representative exposure conditions for fire-resistant building designs and materials.},

	abstract = {Fire poses a signiﬁcant risk to the safety, health, and property of people around the world. However, traditional ‘‘point sensor’’ ﬁre detection techniques for indoor buildings based on air particles, air temperatures, and smoke have a low sensitivity, long response time, and poor stability. Therefore, video-based ﬁre detection has become a particularly eﬃcient and important method for detecting the early signs of a ﬁre. Due to image blur, low illumination, ﬂame-like interference and other factors, there is a certain error rate of ﬁre recognition using video ﬂame recognition methods. According to our previous study of a multi-feature ﬂame recognition algorithm, a novel ﬂame recognition algorithm based on free radical emission spectroscopy during combustion is investigated in this paper. First, multiple features are extracted from the video images by employing our proposed processing scheme. Then, the features are post-processed by a temporal smoothing algorithm to eliminate the error recognition rate, which is caused by the similar characteristics of objects between ﬂame-like and real ﬂame areas. In the temporal smoothing experiments, the proposed method achieves the true positive rates of 0.965 and 0.937 for butane ﬂames and forest ﬁre, respectively. Additionally, the spectral signals of {OH}, {CH}, C2 and other free radicals in the combustion objects were acquired by the spectrometer. The vibrational temperature and rotational temperature are calculated after identiﬁcation of the A2D ﬁ X2P transition of the {CH} (410–440 nm). The ﬂames-like are completely rejected by the proposed method in the validation experiment. In the subsequent butane combustion experiment, the vibrational temperature of the butane was 4896 K, and the rotational temperature was 2290 K. The experimental results show that real ﬁres can be precisely recognized and that the combustion temperature can be determined from the {CH} emission spectroscopy. This novel method provides a new viewpoint for ﬁre detection and recognition.},

Past work by the authors demonstrated for the ﬁrst-time that wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers may accumulate in these stagnation planes. While those experiments demonstrated this important phenomenon, due to the limited duration of ﬁrebrand showers of the original {NIST} Batch-Feed Firebrand Generator, it was not possible to perform a more systematic study. To this end, a series of detailed experiments were performed using the recently developed {NIST} Continuous-Feed Firebrand Generator capable of ﬁrebrand showers of unlimited duration. Full-scale walls of varying size were placed downstream of the device and the wind speed was varied in increments up to 10 m/s. The experiments were conducted in the Building Research Institute's Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility ({FRWTF}). For a given wall size exposed to speciﬁc ﬁrebrand size/mass distribution, it was observed that wind speed inﬂuences not only the spatial location and extent of the accumulated ﬁrebrands in the stagnation plane in front of the wall, but also the nature of the smoldering combustion intensity of the accumulated ﬁrebrands. The experiments demonstrated that higher wind speeds (10 m/s) did not promote accumulation of ﬁrebrands in stagnation planes in front of walls. The data may be used to provide guidance to appropriate separation distances that combustibles should be placed near structures and is also of great use to develop and validate numerical models of ﬁrebrand accumulation.},

The smoul­ dering behaviour strongly depends on peat moisture, which can change significantly and quickly due to weather or human activities. Aims. We simulated wildfire in peatlands at the field scale and, for the first time, included daily variations of peat moisture. Methods. We developed {KAPAS} {II}, a cellular automaton that includes flaming and smouldering, and coupled it with {PEATCLSM} (Catchment Land Surface Model) for peatland hydrology. Key results. Compared with the satellite observations over 90 days of a 2018 wildfire in Borneo, {KAPAS} {II} predictions provide good agreement for burn scars (79\% accuracy) and for the number of smouldering hotspots (85\% accuracy). For the same burn scar, the model predicts that 54 ha of peat would smoulder when considering daily moisture variations, but only 12 ha if moisture was constant. Simulations at the same Borneo location, but in different years from 2000 to 2019, show the importance of seasons and climate events like El Niño. Conclusion. Temporal variations in peat moisture, which are strongly influenced by weather and climate, are important to predict the behaviour and severity of peatland wildfires. Implications. This model improves our under­ standing of wildfire behaviour in peatlands and can contribute to its mitigation.},

From a land management point of view, it is important to identify the {WUI} to determine areas to prioritise for ﬁre risk prevention. It is also important to know the ﬁre risk mitigation measures available to select the most appropriate for each speciﬁc context. In this systematic review, deﬁnitions of the {WUI} were investigated and physical mitigation measures for reducing the risk of ﬁre were examined from a land management perspective. The {PRISMA} 2020 Statement was applied to records published until 31 December 2022 and retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and other research engines. A total of 162 publications from scientiﬁc journals and the grey literature were scrutinised and selected for analysis. Only publications providing an original deﬁnition of the {WUI} or proposing physical measures to reduce ﬁre risk at the interface were retained, while those relating to emergency management and social perception were not considered. The risk of bias was reduced by internal cross-assessment by the research team. Deﬁnitions of the {WUI} (n = 40 publications) changed according to the research objective, varying broadly in identiﬁcation of the anthropogenic and the wildland components of the interface. Terminology varied according to the deﬁnition, and the term wildland–human interface ({WHI}) was found to be more comprehensive than {WUI}. Methodological deﬁnitions of the interface ranged from using aggregated data through to identiﬁcation of the buildings at risk in the interface with considerable precision. Five categories of physical ﬁre risk mitigation measures (n = 128 publications) were identiﬁed: clearance distances, landscaping, wildland fuel management, land planning, and buildings design and materials. The most effective measures were those applied at early stages of urban development, and maintenance of assets and vegetation is crucial for preparedness. This review represents an analysis of scientiﬁc evidence on which land managers can base their actions to reduce the ﬁre hazard risk in the {WUI}. The number of studies investigating the {WUI} is considerable, but experimental studies and quantitative results are scarce, and better communication and coordination among research groups and land management agencies is advisable.

Layout configura­ tions play a pivotal role in fire spread, with isolated islands of combustibles effective in reducing spread rate, aligning with existing mitigation strategies. Conclusion. Despite using a 1D domain and limitations on spatial and temporal variability, our model provides insights into underlying phenomena observed in {WUI} fires and their mitigation. It offers early-stage development of strategies for managing structure materials and landscape layouts. Implications. Our model and findings provide insights into {WUI} fire dynamics, paving the way for advanced mitigation strategies.},

Both types are present in most wildfires, and despite being fundamentally different in chemical and physical terms, one transitions to the other. Traditionally, science has focused on flames, while smouldering is often misinterpreted. But smouldering wildfires are emerging as a global concern because they cause extensive air pollution, emit very large amounts of carbon, are difficult to detect and suppress, and could accelerate climate change. Central to the topic are smouldering peat fires that lead to the largest fires on Earth. Smouldering also dominates the residual burning after flames have died out and firebrand ignition. Finally, smouldering is an important part of Arctic wildfires, which are increasing in frequency. Here, we present a scientific overview of smouldering wildfires, the associated environmental and health issues, including climate change, and the challenges in prevention and mitigation.},

	abstract = {Wildland-Urban Interface ({WUI}) ﬁres have become a problem of great concern across multiple continents. An important mechanism of structure ignition in {WUI} ﬁres and urban ﬁres is the production of ﬁrebrands. During {WUI} ﬁres, decking assemblies have been observed to be an ignition vulnerability based on post-ﬁre damage surveys conducted by {NIST} and elsewhere. The authors have conducted scoping experiments and demonstrated the dangers of the dynamic process of continual, winddriven ﬁrebrand showers landing on decking assemblies for wind speeds of 6 m/s. In this study, eight full-scale experiments were conducted with wood decking assemblies under a wind speed of 8 m/s. The basis for these new investigations was twofold: observe possible vulnerabilities of wood decking assemblies to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrands at higher wind speed as ﬁrebrand accumulation patterns were expected to be inﬂuenced by wind speed, and examine if wall ignition occurred due to the burning decking assembly. To this end, sections of wood decking assemblies (1.2 m by 1.2 m) were constructed and attached to a reentrant corner assembly. The deck/reentrant corner assembly was then exposed to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrand bombardment generated by a full-scale Continuous Feed Firebrand Generator installed in the Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility ({FRWTF}) at the Building Research Institute ({BRI}) in Japan. The mass of ﬁrebrands required for ﬂaming ignitions under a wind speed of 8 m/s was considerably less compared with those under a wind speed of 6 m/s. This result is postulated to be due to higher ﬁrebrand surface temperatures as the wind speed was increased. For the decking assembly to wall ignition studies, the interface between the decking assembly and the wall appeared to be a weak point; this is not addressed in the current test methods.},

While the demand for plastic products is growing, from the 29.5 Mt of collected waste in Europe only 35\% was recycled, while 42\% represents energy recovery and 23\% was landfilled in 2020 [1]. Plastic pyrolysis provides a promising alternative method to utilize plastic waste as secondary raw material [2]. An advantage over traditional waste processing methods is the possibility to obtain valuable products with pyrolysis. The products obtained from thermal decomposition are the pyrolysis coke, gas and oil. {GC}-{MS} analysis showed that the composition of the plastic waste gasoline ({PWG}) derived from low- and high-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene show similarity to commercially available gasoline. It is possible to operate {IC} engines using {PWG}, however, certain parameters such as the olefin concentration do not meet the {EN}-228 European gasoline standard, therefore further refinement, such as hydrotreatment is needed to achieve standard quality. Another advantage of this method is the utilization of the gaseous pyrolysis product. The pyrolysis gas consists of high concentrations of combustible hydrocarbons with C1-C4 carbon numbers. In part the gas could be used to provide the energy requirements of the process.},

	abstract = {Combustibility of insulation and external façade remains a critical issue for many countries as they are commonly found in modern building structures. While standardised fire tests can be carried out to examine the flammability limits of building polymers, they cannot inform us of the toxicity and smoke productions of the underlying materials. With recent advancements in computational approaches (i.e. surface regression porous media pyrol­ ysis model as depicted in Fig. 1) and its synergy with experimental characterisation techniques, a systematic framework is proposed to robustly realise the potential risks associated with any building polymer samples. This involves a five-step procedure including (i) performing {TGA} on the core polymer materials to acquire thermal and gas decomposition data; (ii) extracting pyrolysis kinetics data from {TGA} results via an initial estimation of the Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose method; (iii) optimise kinetics parameters via a shuffled complex evolution ({SCE}) algorithms to match {DTG} curves for an accurate representation of the degradation behaviour; (iv) conduct reduce-scale simulations via computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) in a cone calorimeter environment and compare against experimental data with/without aluminium covering for validation; (v) use the validated model to predict gaseous products, toxicity and soot particles releases and benchmark against Cone Calorimeter data. Once this database is established, it can be used for up-scaled modelling in a multiple-storey building setting. In this work, one of the most commonly applied building polymers for insulation applications and external façade systems: polyethelene ({PE}) is taken as an example to establish a numerical database. To learn whether the effect of flame-retardants that suppresses the flammability and intermediate combustion gases releases of {PE} can be replicated in the {CFD} modelling, the {PE} was also treated by plasma treatment subsequently immersed by gra­ phene oxide as fillers. The reductions in heat, smoke and carbon monoxide releases were benchmarked against the pure {PE} data while the increased char formation offered by the carbon-based enhancing agent is examined from a numerical perspective.},

An experimental series was undertaken to vary the board spacing from 0 mm (no gaps), 5 mm, and 10 mm, to determine if it was possible to observe reduced ignition propensity of full-scale wood decking assemblies fitted to a reentrant corner wall assembly. In these experiments, three common wood types were used and firebrand showers were directed at the wall/decking assemblies using wind speeds of 8 m/s generated using a realistic-scale wind tunnel. Based on the results of these experiments, it was observed that board spacing significantly influenced ignition propensity of these as­ semblies. Ignition events were observed for all board spacing considered and in particular, more ignition points were observed for a board spacing of 10 mm.},

The {XPS} flame in the vertical channel is turbulent. There is a correlation between the flame height and pyrolysis length: xf = mxnp, where m and n vary with the change in structure factor and coverage rate. Upward flame spread rate decreases first and then increases as β rises. When 0 ≤ β {\textless} 0.2, the restraining effect of vertical channel on air entrainment dominates, while for 0.2 ≤ β ≤ 0.8, the heat feedback from curtain wall dominates. When β = 0, the influence of α on flame spread rate is not significant. The flame spread rate increases with increasing α when 0.2 ≤ β ≤ 0.8. A model is established to predict the flame spread rate under different coverage rates and structure factors. Compared with experimental results, the prediction error is smaller than 10\%. Larger values of flame height and flame spread rate correspond to higher fire hazard.

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to numerically investigate the ignition and combustion of pulverized solid fuels in turbulent conditions and to assess different modeling strategies relevant to large-eddy simulations ({LES}). The investigations show that due to the high Stokes number of solid particles, they do not necessarily follow the flow. At Stokes numbers around unity, particle–turbulence interactions can lead to particle clustering and change the ignition behavior. According to observations, ignition is most likely to happen outside the formed clusters, where suitable thermo-chemical conditions exist. To study this behavior, direct numerical simulations ({DNS}) of reactive particles in turbulent conditions employing detailed kinetics for solid and gas phases were performed. Pulverized fuel combustion was modeled using the point-particle approximation to represent the dispersed phase in an Eulerian–Lagrangian framework. Isotropic turbulence was employed to investigate the influence of particle clustering on the ignition process. After investigating the physical aspects of the ignition process, the {DNS} dataset was used as a benchmark for evaluating the reduced-order flamelet models usually employed in {LES} of pulverized fuel combustion during the ignition process. The flamelet model performance in predicting the selected quantity of interest was compared to the {DNS} data. An error decomposition was performed using the optimal estimator concept. Finally, the prediction accuracy of presumed {PDFs} is evaluated by calculating the errors in predicting the quantity of interest using different {PDFs} compared to the predictions using the accurate sub-filter joint distribution of the {DNS} data.},

	abstract = {The ignition of a stream of coal particles under oxy-fuel atmosphere is studied numerically in a laminar flow. Devolatilization of coal particles is modeled with the chemical percolation devolatilization ({CPD}) method coupled with a detailed chemistry model for homogeneous reactions. The particle and gas phase interactions are modeled with a fully coupled Euler-Lagrange code. A parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of particle number density, gas temperature, and velocity on ignition. We found that increasing particle number density delays the onset of ignition. Delayed ignition in denser streams is due to the lower gas temperature, which is caused by the higher energy required for particle heating. In addition, increasing particle number density leads to a more continuous and narrower flame front. Particle heating and ignition induce velocity variations in the gas phase through the coupling with particles. In the denser stream, velocity variations become significant and compromise the validity of a constant velocity assumption that is usually made in computing ignition delay time from the observed ignition location. It is also found that high particle slip velocities lead to a locally low volatile concentration and low temperature, and consequently increase ignition delay time.},

	abstract = {Biomass is increasingly being recognized as a promising carrier for both heat, energy and chemicals production. However, several aspects still require intense research activity towards a better design and optimization of industrial combustors, gasiﬁers and pyrolyzer. The objective of this work is to update the {CRECK} kinetic mechanism of biomass pyrolysis, allowing a better prediction of both yield and composition of the solid residue (biochar). Moreover, further model modiﬁcations allow to better describe the variability of hemicellulose in diﬀerent biomass. To this end, a large set of literature experimental data is collected and organized into a database, which is used to further tune and validate the proposed kinetic mechanism. Although the kinetic model maintains the previous agreement in respect of the rate of biomass pyrolysis, formation and distribution of gas and tar products, the novelty of this work is the greater attention to the predictions of biochar yield and composition, in a wide range of operative conditions. The model describes the solid residue as a mixture of pure carbon together with lumped metaplastic compounds, which represent the whole range of oxygenated and hydrogenated groups bonded to the carbonaceous matrix. These metaplastic species are released to the gas phase with their own kinetics and describe the change of both mass loss and elemental composition of the biochar. These comprehensive predictions of biochar composition are crucial for an accurate description of the successive oxidation and gasiﬁcation processes.},

	abstract = {Over the past years, wildfires have raged with unprecedented intensity across the world, becoming a growing problem, as weather conditions conductive to wildfire ignition and spread will increase in frequency and severity worldwide. This, coupled with a growing human expansion, leads to an increase in wildfire risk and in the threat to wildland-urban interface ({WUI}) communities. Commonly, definitions for {WUI} areas consider homes, com­ mercial facilities, office and public buildings. This excludes industrial installations, where wildfires can trigger accidents or cascading events leading to extremely dangerous situations for the population causing enormous economic losses. In this paper, the problem associated to the wildland-industrial interface ({WII}) is analyzed. A methodology to obtain a global {WII} map is described, and the first {WII} maps for Europe and Asia are provided. Results show that, in Europe, 2.5\% of the land and 6\% of vegetated areas are {WII}, while in Asia these are respectively 0.24\% and 0.5\%. An analysis of how wildfire triggered industrial accidents can be considered when performing quantitative risk assessments ({QRA}) in industrial sites is also performed, identifying the current state of the art and research gaps, with the aim of helping industry, public authorities and policy makers, for better accident prevention, preparedness and response.},

Devolatilization is computed using the chemical percolation devolatilization ({CPD}) model. The {CPD} model is coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracking method in the framework of a multiphysics, multiscale Navier–Stokes solver. Combustion in the gas phase is described using finite rate chemistry. The numerical results for ignition are compared with available experimental data and a remarkably good agreement is observed. The effect on flame ignition of the different phases characterizing the release of volatile gases is assessed. These different phases manifest themselves in two distinct peaks in the devolatilization rate and it is observed that ignition can occur during the first volatile release or on the onset of the second, depending on the particle size and gas temperature. It is found that an increase of ignition delay time in oxy-atmosphere compared to the air case is related to the depletion of radicals that react with the abundant carbon dioxide of the oxy-atmosphere, while the increased heat capacity of the mixture does not play a role.},

The numerical modelling was conducted using {FireFOAM}, a coupled ﬁre-atmosphere model underpinned by a large eddy simulation ({LES}) solver, which is based on the Eddy Dissipation Concept ({EDC}) combustion model and implemented in the {OpenFOAM} platform (an open source {CFD} tool). The numerical data were validated using the aerodynamic measurements of a full-scale building model in the absence of ﬁre effects. The results highlighted the physical phenomena contributing to the ﬁre spread pattern and its thermal impact on the building. In addition, frequency analysis of the surface temperature ﬂuctuations ahead of the ﬁre front showed that the presence of a building inﬂuences the growth and formation of buoyant instabilities, which directly affect the behaviour of the ﬁre’s plume. The coupled ﬁre-atmosphere modelling presented here constitutes a fundamental step towards better understanding the behaviour and potential impacts of large wind-driven wildland ﬁres in wildland-urban interface ({WUI}) areas.},

This is particularly evident in Europe, where ongoing changes in land use have strongly modified fire patterns over the last decades. Although satellite data by the European Forest Fire Information System provide large-scale wildland fire statistics across European countries, there is still a crucial need to collect and summarize in-depth local analysis and understanding of the wildland fire condition and associated challenges across Europe. This article aims to provide a general overview of the current wildland fire patterns and challenges as perceived by national representatives, supplemented by national fire statistics (2009–2018) across Europe. For each of the 31 countries included, we present a perspective authored by scientists or practitioners from each respective country, representing a wide range of disciplines and cultural backgrounds. The authors were selected from members of the {COST} Action “Fire and the Earth System: Science \& Society” funded by the European Commission with the aim to share knowledge and improve communication about wildland fire. Where relevant, a brief overview of key studies, particular wildland fire challenges a country is facing, and an overview of notable recent fire events are also presented. Key perceived challenges included (1) the lack of consistent and detailed records for wildland fire events, within and across countries, (2) an increase in wildland fires that pose a risk to properties and human life due to high population densities and sprawl into forested regions, and (3) the view that, irrespective of changes in management, climate change is likely to increase the frequency and impact of wildland fires in the coming decades. Addressing challenge (1) will not only be valuable in advancing national and pan-European wildland fire management strategies, but also in evaluating perceptions (2) and (3) against more robust quantitative evidence.},

	abstract = {This booklet prepared by the European Commission with the support of fire management experts in the countries, provides a summary of the current and future trends of wildfires in Europe and tools to monitor them at European and country level. The report includes an overview of existing land-based wildfire prevention and good practices, and showcases good practices that can save lives. These guidelines are well aligned with the goals of the European Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy. We are convinced that together we can get better prepared to address the increasing threat of wildfires in Europe and can create a more effective response to an ever more frequent common problem, with important benefits for our citizens and the natural environment we depend on. An expert group is a consultative body initiated by the European Commission to provide it with advice on specific topics. The Expert Group on Forest Fires (hereafter: the {EGFF}) was set up in 1998 and includes experts from the group's member countries' environmental or forestry administrations. Representing over 40 countries from the {EU} and its eastern and southern neighborhood, the {EGFF} is a key forum for the Commission to monitor the current trends toward increasingly frequent and catastrophic wildfires, and to help determine adequate and effective European responses in cooperation with the {EU} Member States. Managed jointly by the Commission's Environment and Joint Research Centre Directorate Generals, the {EGFF} meets twice a year - ahead of and after the "main" wildfire season. The current work of the group focuses on the development of common criteria for wildfire risk assessments and recommendations for fire risk reduction by landscape and forest management. In addition to these key activities, the {EGFF} also contributes to the further development of the European Forest Fire Information System {EFFIS}, to the drafting of the Commission's annual 'Wildfires in Europe, Middle East and North Africa' report as well as to information exchanges on fire-resistant forests and sustainable forest management. Moreover, it exchanges on good wildfire prevention practices and lessons learned throughout the entire fire cycle. This booklet is an example of how exchanges of information and good practices at European and international level can facilitate a better understanding of land-based wildfire prevention and facilitate effective responses},

	shorttitle = {A Methane Mechanism for Oxy-Fuel Combustion},
	abstract = {While fuel combustion in oxygen-enriched environments provides a number of significant advantages, such as reduced nitrogen oxide emissions and high carbon dioxide purity for carbon sequestration, it is characterized by different physico-chemical oxidation behavior than combustion in air. Compared to nitrogen, carbon dioxide has different specific heat and effective Lewis number, and is chemically more active. Therefore, chemical mechanisms developed for the oxidation of fuel/air mixtures can fail to predict targets of interest for oxy-combustion accurately. In this study, a chemical mechanism of methane, which has been previously validated with data from experiments using air, is evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy at oxy-conditions by comparing against available literature data. The validation takes various combustion properties into account, including ignition delay times, laminar burning velocities, and extinction strain rates, and covers a wide range of experimental conditions with respect to temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, and carbon dioxide concentration. As additional targets, extinction strain rates of non-premixed oxy-methane flames are determined in a counterflow burner at conditions, where literature data have not yet been reported. The extensive validation demonstrates that the mechanism is able to describe oxy-methane combustion with reasonable prediction accuracy. For further insights into the underlying kinetics of diffusion flames of methane in oxy-atmosphere compared to its oxidation in air, reaction path and sensitivity analyses are performed using the validated mechanism. Notable differences between both combustion regimes are observed in the branching ratios of H-abstraction reactions by {OH} and H radicals and in the consumption channels of singlet methylene, which is a key species in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.},

	abstract = {Ignition and combustion of pulverized solid fuel is investigated in a laminar burner. The two-dimensional {OH} radical field is measured in the experiments, providing information on the first onset of ignition and a detailed characterization of the flame structure for the single particle. In addition, particle velocity and diameter are tracked in time in the experiments. Simulations are carried out with a Lagrangian point-particle approach fully coupled with an Eulerian solver for the gas-phase, which includes detailed chemistry and transport. The numerical simulation results are compared with the experimental measurements in order to investigate the ignition characteristics. The effect of the slip velocity, i.e. the initial velocity difference between the gas-phase and the particle, is investigated numerically. For increasing slip velocity, the ignition delay time decreases. For large slip velocities, the decrease in ignition delay time is found to saturate to a value which is about 40\% smaller than the ignition delay time at zero slip velocity. Performing a simulation neglecting the dependency of the Nusselt number on the slip velocity, it is found that this dependency does not play a role. On the contrary, it is found that the decrease of ignition delay time induced by the slip velocity is due to modifications of the temperature field around the particle. In particular, the low-temperature fluid related to the energy sink due to particle heating is transported away from the particle position when the slip velocity is non-zero; therefore, the particle is exposed to larger temperatures. Finally, the effect of particle swell is investigated using a model for the particle swelling based on the {CPD} framework. With this model, we observed negligible differences in ignition delay time compared to the case in which swelling is not included. This is related to the negligible swelling predicted by this model before ignition. However, this is inconsistent with the experimental measurements of particle diameter, showing a significant increase of diameter even before ignition. In further simulations, the measured swelling was directly prescribed, using an analytical fit at the given conditions. With this approach, it is found that the inclusion of swelling reduces the ignition delay time by about 20\% for small particles while it is negligible for large particles.},

          Wildfires present a significant threat to ecosystems and human life, particularly as
global climate change amplifies the likelihood of extreme fire events. This study
develops a machine learning-based wildfire susceptibility model for Germany, using
data between 2003 and 2023. The primary goal is to identify the dominant wildfire
predictors and create monthly susceptibility maps. A Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm
was trained on remote sensing data and a comprehensive set of predictors, including
meteorological, terrain, and land cover variables. The results indicate that surface air
pressure, elevation, vegetation health, and proximity to urban areas are the most
important factors in predicting fire susceptibility. The model achieved 89\% accuracy,
demonstrating the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in wildfire risk modeling.
The monthly susceptibility map for July 2022 highlights northeastern Germany as
particularly vulnerable to fire outbreaks. The results offer valuable insights for targeted
wildfire prevention and resource allocation, emphasizing the importance of both
temporal and spatial dimensions in managing wildfire risks.},

To understand the mechanism of these losses, small-scale experiments designed to capture heating from firebrand piles and to describe the process of ignition were conducted using laboratory-fabricated cylindrical wooden firebrands. Two heat flux measurement methods were compared, and the influences of firebrand diameter, pile mass, and wind on heating from firebrand piles were explored. Diameter had little effect on heating, pile mass a moderate effect, and wind a large effect. Peak heat fluxes showed distinct differences between heat fluxes produced by firebrand piles as opposed to individual firebrands, which have been studied exclusively on the small-scale in the past. Above a critical mass, piles did not produce higher heat fluxes; however, they heated fuels for an increasingly longer duration and over a larger area. Water-cooled heat flux gauges provided reliable heat flux measurements for large firebrand piles and an array of thin-skin calorimeters indicated significant spatial variation in heat flux. A recipient fuel transitioned from smoldering to flaming under an adequate wind speed soon after a firebrand pile was deposited on its surface.},

In this work, we propose a framework to better characterize firebrand flows and facilitate exposure comparisons across experimental cases.

An improved version of the Emberometer, geared towards field use with enhanced firebrand detection capability and data processing pipelines, is presented. The device was used to investigate, in outdoor settings, a firebrand shower artificially generated to produce mixed amounts of smol­ dering and flaming particles. The ability to perform meaningful quantitative exposure comparisons, via metrics such as Cumulative Particle Count ({CPC}) and Particle Number Flux ({PNF}), is demonstrated. A sub-set of 3Dtracked firebrand images was used to train several Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) to recognize fire­ brand combustion state. The best performing model was selected to process the entire tracking dataset (over 70,000 firebrand images), and time-resolved volumetric number densities of both smoldering and flaming par­ ticles were derived, a first for complex airborne firebrand flows.},

In this study, methane is used as supplement to liquid diesel fuel due to its benefits like high knock resistance and clean combustion. A deep understanding of the in-cylinder process is required for engine design and combustion controller development. To investigate the impact of different input parameters such as injection duration, injection timing, and substitution rate on varying output parameters like load, combustion phasing, and engine-out emissions, numerous investigations were conducted. Engine speed, global equivalence ratio, and injection pressure were held constant. The experiments were carried out in a modified single-cylinder compression ignition engine. The results reveal regimes with different dependencies between injection timing of diesel fuel and combustion phasing. This work demonstrates the potential of the diesel-dual-fuel concept by combining sophisticated combustion control with the favorable combustion mode.

	abstract = {The condensing gas boiler technology has received increasing attention due to its very high eﬃciency of more than 90\%, which is an increase of more than 15\% compared to non-condensing boiler devices. With this, condensing gas boilers oﬀer the chance to decrease the energy consumption and {CO}2 emissions for domestic hot water and heating. While further increasing the energy eﬃciency of condensing boiler devices, pollutant emissions have to be considered as well since they are a threat to human health and therefore subject to continuously intensiﬁed governmental restrictions. In this study, a comprehensive investigation of the full-scale heating unit of a commercial condensing gas boiler was performed. Local measurements at diﬀerent axial positions revealed an inhomogeneous distribution of {CO} and {NO} emissions due to varying temperature levels in the burnt region. Resolved simulations with ﬁnite rate chemistry identiﬁed a quenching of the {CO} oxidation reactions due to a fast depletion of {OH} radicals. Consequently, the {CO} concentration in the cooled exhaust gas is signiﬁcantly higher than expected from chemical equilibrium calculations. Regarding {NO} formation, the majority of {NO} is found to be produced within the ﬂame front, while only a small part is formed in the postﬂame region. A detailed pathway analysis pointed out that besides the well known thermal {NO} pathway, the {NNH} pathway has the highest contribution to the overall {NO} emissions. These insights open up possibilities to develop new condensing boiler generations where emission levels below the permitted limits can be achieved.},

	abstract = {Allene and 1-buten-3-yne (C4H4) represent important intermediates in forming polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soot. Hydrogen abstraction from allene provides the resonance-stabilized propargyl radical fueling molecular growth kinetics. However, the kinetics associated with 1-buten-3-yne and its involvement in the formation and growth of aromatics still need to be fully understood. One of the challenges is the complexity of the relevant chemistry in most combustion environments, which includes fuel-specific reactions in addition to reactions of C4 species. This work attempts to simplify the relevant chemistry by using 1-buten-3-yne as fuel for the first time in counterflow diffusion flames. A pure allene and a 75∕25 mol \% allene/1-buten-3-yne blend flame were examined using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The boundary and operating conditions feature close equilibrium temperature, stoichiometric mixture fraction, and strain rate, allowing a meaningful kinetic comparison between the flames. Speciation data from both instruments were consistent for the vast majority of the species. The experimental results were compared to simulations performed with an updated, extensively validated, detailed chemical kinetic model. Notably, adding 1-buten-3-yne to the fuel reduced benzene and increased the formation of naphthalene. This showcases that the availability of C3 and C4 species impacts the kinetics of the two species differently. Pathway analyses revealed that benzene formation highly depends on C3 species, while naphthalene relies on C3 and C4 species. Naphthalene formation depends on the abundance of 1,3-butadiyne (C4H2) and proceeds mainly via the C4 + 2 C3 and 2 C3 + C4 pathways. Other pathways, such as {HACA} and phenyl radical-addition to C4H4, exhibited a minor impact. The present work highlights that uncertainties in the C4H2-related chemistry are highly relevant for the modeling of aromatics and may affect naphthalene predictions. Therefore, the experimental data of this study will provide a unique validation target for future kinetic model development.},
