	abstract = {Spotfires are a major problem in bushfire management, greatly complicate suppression efforts, and contribute to fires breaking control lines. Firebrands are often implicated in structure loss, and in extreme circumstances have been observed to ignite new fires over 30 km ahead of the parent fire. Existing prediction techniques do not accommodate the problem of such long-range spotting, and the meteorological and fire conditions that lead to such events are not well understood. We present a computationally inexpensive, physically based model of ember transport within bushfire plumes, with four components: an integral plume model, a model of turbulence within the plume, a probabilistic model of ember transport by the plume, and a model of transport beneath the plume. The predicted ember landing distributions from this model compare satisfactorily to the explicit ember-transport calculations of Thurston et al. (2017) and to observations (Cruz et al., 2012). We examine the sensitivity of the simple model to its input parameters. The 90th percentile of spotting distance increases with increasing fire power and decreases with increasing ember terminal fall velocity and fire radius. Where there is a meteorological inversion or stable layer and the plume updraft is sufficiently strong to carry embers to that height, the stable layer substantially limits the transport distance, with increased height favoring longer-range transport. The effect of wind speed is complex, due to the competing factors of faster horizontal transport but suppressed vertical plume development with stronger winds.},

	abstract = {Changes in climate, land use, and land management impact the occurrence and severity of wildland fires in many parts of the world. This is particularly evident in Europe, where ongoing changes in land use have strongly modified fire patterns over the last decades. Although satellite data by the European Forest Fire Information System provide large-scale wildland fire statistics across European countries, there is still a crucial need to collect and summarize in-depth local analysis and understanding of the wildland fire condition and associated challenges across Europe. This article aims to provide a general overview of the current wildland fire patterns and challenges as perceived by national representatives, supplemented by national fire statistics (2009–2018) across Europe. For each of the 31 countries included, we present a perspective authored by scientists or practitioners from each respective country, representing a wide range of disciplines and cultural backgrounds. The authors were selected from members of the {COST} Action “Fire and the Earth System: Science \& Society” funded by the European Commission with the aim to share knowledge and improve communication about wildland fire. Where relevant, a brief overview of key studies, particular wildland fire challenges a country is facing, and an overview of notable recent fire events are also presented. Key perceived challenges included (1) the lack of consistent and detailed records for wildland fire events, within and across countries, (2) an increase in wildland fires that pose a risk to properties and human life due to high population densities and sprawl into forested regions, and (3) the view that, irrespective of changes in management, climate change is likely to increase the frequency and impact of wildland fires in the coming decades. Addressing challenge (1) will not only be valuable in advancing national and pan-European wildland fire management strategies, but also in evaluating perceptions (2) and (3) against more robust quantitative evidence.},

	abstract = {A stochastic model motivated by the Lagrangian transported probability density function method for turbulent reacting flows and the cellular automata approach for forest fires was put together to simulate propagation of fires in terrains with inhomogeneous composition. In contrast to the usual cellular automata models for fires where the probability of ignition is prescribed, here the ignition of cells is determined by a random walk that mimics turbulent convection and diffusion of the hot gases and firebrands from upwind and neighbouring fire fronts. Radiation is also included. The model is aimed at speed of computation while approximating the key physics through only a few terrain-related inputs and tunable parameters representing fire intensity, hot gas and ember decay timescales, cell ignition delay and local turbulence. These parameters were calibrated against controlled fire experiments and the model was then used to give reasonable predictions for fires of increasing complexity. The presented framework allows improvements for more accurate representation of the flammable material characteristics, fire-induced flow modifications, and most other phenomena present in fires, hence providing an extendable and simple yet physically-realistic novel modelling approach. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Wildland fires that spread into developed areas, i.e., the wildland-urban interface ({WUI}), have resulted in numerous disasters over the past few decades, claiming the lives of civilians and causing large-scale property destruction. In these communities, fires often ignite structures by the deposition of small burning embers (firebrand attack) which is unique to these fires and not yet well understood. This study quantifies the in-flight thermal characteristics of firebrands generated by three typical vegetative fuels, namely stone pine, eucalyptus and oak found in the {WUI}, inside a lab-scale wind tunnel. The effects of fuel characteristics (i.e., species, moisture content and twig diameter) and ambient condition (i.e., crosswind speed) on surface temperature, number generation rate ({NGR}), and heat release rate ({HRRfb}) were investigated. Firebrand surface temperatures, measured using ratio pyrometry, were insensitive to fuel moisture content and mean twig diameter but higher at higher crosswind speeds. Surface temperature was used to estimate the {HRRfb} of each firebrand based on a surface energy balance and compared to overall emissions measurements. While ratio pyrometry best captured firebrand temperatures, infrared video worked well to track firebrands and derive a {NGR} as a function of time. Correlations were used to organize the {NGR}, {HRRfb}, and mass generation rate ({MGR}) under different test conditions, and unique correlations were derived for each fuel species. Results showed that the peak {NGRs} and {MGRs} for all three fuel species were positively related to crosswind speed but negatively related to fuel moisture content and mean twig diameter. The experimental data, correlations and methods disclosed in this study are important to understand the influence of competing processes on firebrand generation, parameterize fire spread models for time-dependent generation, and improve estimates of downstream ignition potential. Experiments must later be validated against large-scale data before widespread application.},

	abstract = {Firebrand spotting is a significant mechanism for structure losses in wildland–urban interface ({WUI}) fires. In this work, the ability of firebrand accumulations to cause flaming ignition of an engineered wood material, Oriented Strand Board ({OSB}), under different flow conditions was experimentally studied. The firebrands were emulated by burning wooden dowels of two sizes, 6.35 \& 12.7 mm. Firebrands were dropped onto on the fuel to form accumulations, with the coverage densities of 0.06 to 0.16 g∕cm2 on the fuel surface. The surface temperature of glowing combustion on the firebrands was measured with color ratio pyrometry. The ignition outcome results show a similar hyperbolic relationship between air flow and coverage density for both firebrand sizes although accumulations of small firebrands can cause the ignition faster. A firebrand combustion model was adopted to predict the surface temperature of accumulated firebrands considering re-radiation between nearby firebrands. A correlation between the ignition time and characteristics of accumulations was also established based on a theoretical combustion and heat transfer analysis.},

A direct comparison of this simplified non-reacting heater setup was undertaken to realistic fuel bed ignition to actual firebrand showers. Firebrand showers were generated using a custom experimental setup developed for this investigation. The novelty of this research is a detailed comparison for the first time to fuel bed ignition from non-reacting heaters to actual firebrand showers, for the same fuel bed type. The focus here is on smoldering ignition ({SI}) of the fuel beds, as this is seen as a complex and least understood aspect of firebrand ignition of actual {WUI} fires. Results indicate that the overall phenomen­ ology of the ignition process is different between a non-reacting car­ tridge heater and a shower of firebrands.

	abstract = {This booklet prepared by the European Commission with the support of fire management experts in the countries, provides a summary of the current and future trends of wildfires in Europe and tools to monitor them at European and country level. The report includes an overview of existing land-based wildfire prevention and good practices, and showcases good practices that can save lives. These guidelines are well aligned with the goals of the European Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy. We are convinced that together we can get better prepared to address the increasing threat of wildfires in Europe and can create a more effective response to an ever more frequent common problem, with important benefits for our citizens and the natural environment we depend on. An expert group is a consultative body initiated by the European Commission to provide it with advice on specific topics. The Expert Group on Forest Fires (hereafter: the {EGFF}) was set up in 1998 and includes experts from the group's member countries' environmental or forestry administrations. Representing over 40 countries from the {EU} and its eastern and southern neighborhood, the {EGFF} is a key forum for the Commission to monitor the current trends toward increasingly frequent and catastrophic wildfires, and to help determine adequate and effective European responses in cooperation with the {EU} Member States. Managed jointly by the Commission's Environment and Joint Research Centre Directorate Generals, the {EGFF} meets twice a year - ahead of and after the "main" wildfire season. The current work of the group focuses on the development of common criteria for wildfire risk assessments and recommendations for fire risk reduction by landscape and forest management. In addition to these key activities, the {EGFF} also contributes to the further development of the European Forest Fire Information System {EFFIS}, to the drafting of the Commission's annual 'Wildfires in Europe, Middle East and North Africa' report as well as to information exchanges on fire-resistant forests and sustainable forest management. Moreover, it exchanges on good wildfire prevention practices and lessons learned throughout the entire fire cycle. This booklet is an example of how exchanges of information and good practices at European and international level can facilitate a better understanding of land-based wildfire prevention and facilitate effective responses},

The approach merges the following two imaging techniques in a single field-deployable diagnostic tool: (1) 3D Particle Tracking Velocimetry (3D-{PTV}), for time-resolved mapping of firebrand 3D trajectories, and (2) 3D Particle Shape Reconstruction (3D-{PSR}), to reconstruct 3D models of individual particles following the Visual Hull principle. This tool offers for the first time the possibility to simultaneously study time-resolved firebrand fluxes and firebrand size distribution to the full extent of their three-dimensional nature within a control volume. Methodologies used in the present work are presented and their technical implementation is discussed. Validation tests to confirm proper tracking/sizing of particles are detailed. The diagnostic tool is applied to a firebrand shower artificially generated at the {NIST} National Fire Research Laboratory. A novel graphic representation, that incorporates both the Cumulative Particle Count ({CPC}, particles m­ −2) and Particle Number Flux ({PNF}, particles ­m−2 ­s−1) as relevant exposure metrics, is presented and the exposure level is compared to that of an actual outdoor fire. Size distributions obtained for airborne firebrands are compared to those achieved through ground collection and strategies to improve the particle shape reconstruction method are discussed.},

	abstract = {Wildland and Wildland Urban Interface ({WUI}) ﬁres are an important problem in many areas of the world and may have major consequences in terms of safety, air quality, and damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the ecosystem. It is expected that with climate changes the wildland ﬁre and {WUI} ﬁre problem will only intensify. The spot ﬁre ignition of a wildland ﬁre by hot (solid, molten or burning) metal fragments/sparks and ﬁrebrands (ﬂaming or glowing embers) is an important ﬁre ignition pathway by which wildﬁres, {WUI} ﬁres, and ﬁres in industrial settings are started and may propagate. There are numerous cases reported of wildﬁres started by hot metal particles from clashing power-lines, or generated by machines, grinding and welding. Once the wildﬁre or structural ﬁre has been ignited and grows, it can spread rapidly through ember spotting, where pieces of burning material (e.g. branches, bark, building materials, etc.) are lofted by the plume of the ﬁre and then transported forward by the wind landing where they can start spot ﬁres downwind. The spot ﬁre problem can be separated in several individual processes: the generation of the particles (metal or ﬁrebrand) and their thermochemical state; their ﬂight by plume lofting and wind drag and the particle thermo-chemical change during the ﬂight; the onset of ignition (smoldering or ﬂaming) of the fuel after the particle lands on the fuel; and ﬁnally, the sustained ignition and burning of the combustible material. Here an attempt has been made to summarize the state of the art of the wildﬁre spotting problem by describing the distinct individual processes involved in the problem and by discussing their know-how status. Emphasis is given to those areas that the author is more familiar with, due to his work on the subject. By characterizing these distinct individual processes, it is possible to attain the required information to develop predictive, physics-base wildﬁre spotting models. Such spotting models, together with topographical maps and wind models, could be added to existing ﬂame spread models to improve the predictive capabilities of landscape-scale wildland ﬁre spread models. These enhanced wildland ﬁre spread models would provide land managers and government agencies with better tools to prescribe preventive measures and fuels treatments before a ﬁre, and allocate suppression resources and issue evacuation orders during a ﬁre.},

To understand the mechanism of these losses, small-scale experiments designed to capture heating from firebrand piles and to describe the process of ignition were conducted using laboratory-fabricated cylindrical wooden firebrands. Two heat flux measurement methods were compared, and the influences of firebrand diameter, pile mass, and wind on heating from firebrand piles were explored. Diameter had little effect on heating, pile mass a moderate effect, and wind a large effect. Peak heat fluxes showed distinct differences between heat fluxes produced by firebrand piles as opposed to individual firebrands, which have been studied exclusively on the small-scale in the past. Above a critical mass, piles did not produce higher heat fluxes; however, they heated fuels for an increasingly longer duration and over a larger area. Water-cooled heat flux gauges provided reliable heat flux measurements for large firebrand piles and an array of thin-skin calorimeters indicated significant spatial variation in heat flux. A recipient fuel transitioned from smoldering to flaming under an adequate wind speed soon after a firebrand pile was deposited on its surface.},

The firebrands generated preserved their shape during their heating. Their projected area was between 0.07 and 12.00 cm2 and their mass ranged from 0.57 mg to 2.66 g. The location of flaming firebrands, the minimal mass and the minimal number of firebrands needed to ignite the slabs were analysed in order to determine the critical conditions of ignition. The ignition of the decking slab only occurred when the firebrands were positioned at the interstices of the wooden slabs and against the leg of the thermoplastic slabs. No ignition occurred when the firebrands were located on the surface of the decking slab. A minimum mass of firebrands of 0.31 g and 0.80 g was necessary to ignite the wooden slabs and the thermoplastic ones, respectively. Less firebrands were needed to ignite wooden slabs than thermoplastic ones.},

Spot fires that occur far from the original burn unit are rare but have consequential ramifications since their prediction and control remains challenging. To facilitate their prediction, we examine three methods for quantifying the landing distribution of firebrands: crude Monte Carlo simulations, importance sampling, and large deviation theory ({LDT}). In particular, we propose an {LDT} method that accurately and parsimoniously quantifies the low probability events at the tail of the landing dis­ tribution. In contrast, Monte Carlo and importance sampling methods are most efficient in quantifying the high probability landing distances near the mode of the distribution. However, they become computationally intractable for quantifying the tail of the distribution due to the large sample size required. We also show that the most probable landing distance grows linearly with the mean characteristic velocity of the wind field. Furthermore, defining the relative landed mass as the proportion of mass landed at a given distance from the main fire, we derive an explicit formula which allows computing this quantity as a function of the landing distribution at a negligible computational cost. We numerically demonstrate our findings on two prescribed wind fields.},

Results indicate that each of these parameters, i.e. spacing, layout, and number of rows, influences the accumulation rate. In all cases tested the mass of embers that accumulated on the rooftops was less than 18\% of the mass that would have accumulated were the building removed. For buildings with roof heights similar to those of the upstream buildings the accumulation rate increases by up to a factor of 10 compared to when there are no upstream buildings. The lowest spacing between buildings produced the largest accumulation. When the target building roof height was larger than upstream buildings, this change was less pronounced.

Short-range firebrands which travel along with the wind, with little or no lofting, are particularly crucial in increasing fire front propagation and damaging structures situated close to the wildland-urban interface. In the Daylesford fire of 1962 in Australia, massive short-range spotting (the process of spot fire ignition and merging of spots caused by firebrands) occurred in the eucalyptus forest and increased the rate of fire spread by roughly three times more than that computed using an operational fire model.

Experiments are conducted with individual glowing firebrands generated from birch discs and placed on a copper thin skin calorimeter of the same diameter, which is embedded in the substrate. The net heat flux from the firebrand to the thin skin calorimeter is obtained from the thermal energy storage in the thin skin calorimeter, plus heat conduction losses to the substrate. Values of peak net heat flux, total heating, duration of heating are reported under different flow conditions from 0.05 m/s to 1.6 m/s. The average peak net heat flux for the disc-shaped birch firebrands is 45 {kW}/m2, and does not change significantly with flow condition. However, there is an increase in the total heating, duration of heating, and total mass consumed as the flow velocity increases.},

At lower wind speeds, firebrands were accumulated somewhere between the dragon and the blocks, consistent with observations in the previous measurements. At higher wind speeds, the firebrands tended to accumulate momentarily before the crossflow region and then accelerate through the gap between the blocks.

	abstract = {Over the past few years, numerous large-scale disasters have occurred due to wildﬁres at the wildland-urban interface ({WUI}). In these ﬁres, spread via the transport of ﬁrebrands (burning embers) plays a signiﬁcant role. Several models have been developed to describe the transport of ﬁrebrands but few, if any, are available which can provide a quantitative means to generate ﬁrebrands at the source of a ﬁre. In this regard, a new methodology is proposed here that uses a wind tunnel to experimentally quantify the generation of ﬁrebrands from {WUI} fuels under diﬀerent ambient conditions. The setup allows for the collection of all generated solid ﬁrebrands and major downstream gaseous species concentrations. Unique ﬁrebrand yield correlations can then be generated for each tested fuel, while also accounting for the heatrelease rate, providing unique validation targets for numerical simulations. Generation of ﬁrebrands from branches of two conifers at a ﬁxed wind speed of 4 m/s are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of this new methodology. A carbon mass balance was utilized to analyze preliminary results and understand how much of the fuel mass transitions to ﬁrebrands vs. gases. These results provide a description of the mass burning process and ultimately tie ﬁrebrand production to a time-dependent heat-release rate for initialization of ﬁrebrand transport in numerical simulations. An average ﬁrebrand yield ranging from 3–4\% of initial dry mass is ultimately presented for lodgepole pine and Douglas ﬁr. Future work is required with larger fuel sizes pertaining to real wildﬁre scenarios; however, the presented methodology can provide valuable data needed to initialize numerical simulations of ﬁrebrand transport, necessary for reconstruction of {WUI} ﬁres and to aid in the development of mitigation strategies for the prevention of future disasters.},

	abstract = {Fire spread occurs via radiation, ﬂame contact, and ﬁrebrands. While ﬁrebrand showers are known to be a cause of spot ﬁres which ignite fuels far from the main ﬁre front, in the case of short distance spot ﬁres, radiation from the main ﬁre may play a role for ﬁrebrand induced ignition processes. Many past investigations have focused on singular eﬀects on ﬁre spread, and little is known about coupled eﬀects. The coupled eﬀect of radiative heat ﬂux and ﬁrebrand showers on ignition processes of fuel beds is studied by using a newly developed experimental protocol. The newly developed protocol includes the addition of a radiant panel to the existing experimental setup of a ﬁrebrand generator coupled to a wind facility. Experiments were performed under an applied wind ﬁeld, as the wind is a key parameter in large outdoor ﬁre spread processes. Results show that radiant heat ﬂux plays an important role for ignition by ﬁrebrands under 6 m/s while little eﬀect was observed under 8 m/ s.},

Firebrands allow for the eﬃcient breaching across fuel-free barriers such as roads, rivers and constructed fuel breaks. Existing observation-based knowledge on medium-distance ﬁrebrand travel is often based on single tree experiments that do not replicate the intensity and convective updraft of a continuous crown ﬁre. Recent advances in acoustic analysis, speciﬁcally pattern detection, has enabled the quantiﬁcation of the rate at which ﬁrebrands are observed in the audio recordings of in-ﬁre cameras housed within ﬁre-proof steel boxes that have been deployed on experimental ﬁres. The audio pattern being detected is the sound created by a ﬂying ﬁrebrand hitting the steel box of the camera. This technique allows for the number of ﬁrebrands per second to be quantiﬁed and can be related to the ﬁre’s location at that same time interval (using a detailed rate of spread reconstruction) in order to determine the ﬁrebrand travel distance. A proof of concept is given for an experimental crown ﬁre that shows the viability of this technique. When related to the ﬁre’s location, key areas of medium-distance spotting are observed that correspond to regions of peak ﬁre intensity. Trends on the number of ﬁrebrands landing per square metre as the ﬁre approaches are readily quantiﬁed using low-cost instrumentation.},

This work is devoted to the development of new algorithms and their testing and, as such, several laboratory experiments were conducted. Wood pellets, bark, and twigs of pine were used to generate ﬁrebrands. An infrared camera ({JADE} J530SB) was used to obtain the necessary thermal video ﬁles. The thermograms were then processed to create an annotated {IR} video database that was used to test both the detector and the tracker. Following these studies, the analysis showed that the Diﬀerence of Gaussians detection algorithm and the Hungarian tracking algorithm upheld the highest level of accuracy and were the easiest to implement. The study also indicated that further development of detection and tracking algorithms using the current approach will not signiﬁcantly improve their accuracy. As such, convolutional neural networks hold high potential to be used as an alternative approach.},

	abstract = {Firebrand spotting is a potential threat to people and infrastructure, which is difﬁcult to predict and becomes more signiﬁcant when the size of a ﬁre and intensity increases. To conduct realistic physics-based modeling with ﬁrebrand transport, the ﬁrebrand generation data such as numbers, size, and shape of the ﬁrebrands are needed. Broadly, the ﬁrebrand generation depends on atmospheric conditions, wind velocity and vegetation species. However, there is no experimental study that has considered all these factors although they are available separately in some experimental studies. Moreover, the experimental studies have ﬁrebrand collection data, not generation data. In this study, we have conducted a series of physics-based simulations on a trial-and-error basis to reproduce the experimental collection data, which is called an inverse analysis. Once the generation data was determined from the simulation, we applied the interpolation technique to calibrate the effects of wind velocity, relative humidity, and vegetation species. First, we simulated Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) tree-burning and quantiﬁed ﬁrebrand generation against the tree burning experiment conducted at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}). Then, we applied the same technique to a prescribed forest ﬁre experiment conducted in the Pinelands National Reserve ({PNR}) of New Jersey, the {USA}. The simulations were conducted with the experimental data of fuel load, humidity, temperature, and wind velocity to ensure that the ﬁeld conditions are replicated in the experiments. The ﬁrebrand generation rate was found to be 3.22 pcs/{MW}/s (pcs-number of ﬁrebrands pieces) from the single tree burning and 4.18 pcs/{MW}/s in the forest ﬁre model. This ﬁnding was complemented with the effects of wind, vegetation type, and fuel moisture content to quantify the ﬁrebrand generation rate.},

	abstract = {Due to the associated ﬁre risk, the wildland–urban interface ({WUI}) has drawn the attention of researchers and managers from a range of backgrounds. From a land management point of view, it is important to identify the {WUI} to determine areas to prioritise for ﬁre risk prevention. It is also important to know the ﬁre risk mitigation measures available to select the most appropriate for each speciﬁc context. In this systematic review, deﬁnitions of the {WUI} were investigated and physical mitigation measures for reducing the risk of ﬁre were examined from a land management perspective. The {PRISMA} 2020 Statement was applied to records published until 31 December 2022 and retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and other research engines. A total of 162 publications from scientiﬁc journals and the grey literature were scrutinised and selected for analysis. Only publications providing an original deﬁnition of the {WUI} or proposing physical measures to reduce ﬁre risk at the interface were retained, while those relating to emergency management and social perception were not considered. The risk of bias was reduced by internal cross-assessment by the research team. Deﬁnitions of the {WUI} (n = 40 publications) changed according to the research objective, varying broadly in identiﬁcation of the anthropogenic and the wildland components of the interface. Terminology varied according to the deﬁnition, and the term wildland–human interface ({WHI}) was found to be more comprehensive than {WUI}. Methodological deﬁnitions of the interface ranged from using aggregated data through to identiﬁcation of the buildings at risk in the interface with considerable precision. Five categories of physical ﬁre risk mitigation measures (n = 128 publications) were identiﬁed: clearance distances, landscaping, wildland fuel management, land planning, and buildings design and materials. The most effective measures were those applied at early stages of urban development, and maintenance of assets and vegetation is crucial for preparedness. This review represents an analysis of scientiﬁc evidence on which land managers can base their actions to reduce the ﬁre hazard risk in the {WUI}. The number of studies investigating the {WUI} is considerable, but experimental studies and quantitative results are scarce, and better communication and coordination among research groups and land management agencies is advisable.

Additionally, the ﬂame height, tree mass decay, vertical ﬂow velocity, and temperature at the top of the trees were measured during the experiments. The relationship between the various parameters was analyzed and a good connection was found. The specimens burnt were mostly young trees, so large particles (e.g., pine cones, thick trunk barks, branches) were not included in this study as they were not present. Actually, the ﬁrebrands produced in the laboratory tests, mainly burning leaves, had a cross-sectional area of {\textless} 1,600 mm2, having the potential to cause short distance spotting (up to tens of meters). Quercus trees are often considered to have a lower ﬁre risk than eucalyptus or pine trees. However, in this study, Quercus suber and Quercus robur were the species that produced more ﬁrebrands, both in terms of number and total volume. The tests with Quercus suber were the only ones using specimens from an adult tree, conﬁrming the great importance of the age of trees in the propensity to release ﬁrebrands. The results obtained with Quercus robur conﬁrmed the high tendency of this species to originate spot ﬁres at a short distance. Thus, these results are of great relevance to afforestation plans and to evaluating the risk of the presence of these species in wildland–urban interface areas.},

	abstract = {The increasing occurrence of severe wildﬁres, coupled with the expansion of the wildland urban interface has increased the number of structures in danger of being destroyed by wildﬁres. Ignition by ﬁrebrands is a signiﬁcant avenue for ﬁre spread and structure loss; thus, understanding processes and parameters that control the ignition of fuel beds by ﬁrebrands is important for reducing these losses. In this study the effect of fuel bed characteristics (i.e., particle size and porous or solid fuel bed) on ignition behavior was considered. Modelling and analysis was conducted to better understand parameters that are dominant in controlling ignition. The fuel beds, made from Douglas-ﬁr shavings, Douglas-ﬁr plates, or cardboard plates, were heated with a cartridge heater (i.e., surrogate ﬁrebrand) to observe ignition. Smaller particles were observed to ignite more readily in porous beds than larger particles when heat transfer from the heater is primarily through conduction. This occurs in large part due to differences in contact area between the fuel bed and the heater coupled with thermal properties of the fuel bed. As particle sizes increased, ignition was more likely to occur at extended times ({\textgreater}100 s) due to the increased importance of radiation heat transfer. Douglas-ﬁr plates were primarily observed to ignite at times where conduction was the dominant mode of heat transfer ({\textless}10 s). Heat ﬂux delivered to the fuel bed was observed to be a more accurate predictor of ignition likelihood and ignition time than heater temperatures. The characteristic ratio of transport and chemical timescales can be used, in conjunction with the measured heat ﬂux and thermal diffusivity of the fuel beds, as a ﬁrst approximation to predict ignition for the porous fuel beds. This suggests that future work focusing on these parameters may produce a general characterization of fuel bed ignition probability across fuel beds materials and morphologies.},

The study was carried out by physics based modeling where the wind flow turbulence was dealt with by large eddy simulation ({LES}) and firebrands were treated by Lagrangian tracking. The Lagrangian equations coupled with the flow solver, accounted for both translational and rotational motions as well as thermochemical degradation of firebrands, assumed to be cylindrical. The dimensions of the structure were varied from 3 to 9 m in the simulations for a parametric study. The simulations were carried out by tracking many firebrands randomly released with a uniform distribution from a horizontal plane 35 m above the ground into the computational domain. The coordinates of the deposited firebrands were used to calculate their normalized number density (number of landed firebrands per unit surface area) to quantify their deposition pattern. On the leewardside of the block, an area, referred to as the safe zone, was identified right behind the structure where firebrands never deposit. The size of the safe zone in the direction perpendicular to the wind was nearly identical to the width of the structure. The length of the safe zone in the wind direction was proportional to the height of the structure. The leeward face of the blocks was never hit by a firebrand. The windward face was hit by many more firebrands than the lateral faces but much less than the top face. The distribution of the number density of the deposited firebrands on the top face was found to be correlated with the flow separation and reattachment on this face.},

Perhaps of all the large outdoor fires, it is wildland fires that spread into urban areas, simply called {WUI} fires that attract the most attention.

	abstract = {Firebrand showers are known for their devastating effects throughout Wildland-Urban Interface ({WUI}) com­ munities threatened by wildfires. In this work, we propose a framework to better characterize firebrand flows and facilitate exposure comparisons across experimental cases. This framework leverages the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) Emberometer, a measurement device that allows time-resolved motion tracking of burning particles in full 3D space. An improved version of the Emberometer, geared towards field use with enhanced firebrand detection capability and data processing pipelines, is presented. The device was used to investigate, in outdoor settings, a firebrand shower artificially generated to produce mixed amounts of smol­ dering and flaming particles. The ability to perform meaningful quantitative exposure comparisons, via metrics such as Cumulative Particle Count ({CPC}) and Particle Number Flux ({PNF}), is demonstrated. A sub-set of 3Dtracked firebrand images was used to train several Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) to recognize fire­ brand combustion state. The best performing model was selected to process the entire tracking dataset (over 70,000 firebrand images), and time-resolved volumetric number densities of both smoldering and flaming par­ ticles were derived, a first for complex airborne firebrand flows.},

The Douglas-fir trees used for the experiments ranged in total height from 2.6 to 5.2 m and the tree moisture content was varied. An array of pans filled with water was used to collect the firebrands that were generated from the burning trees. This ensured that firebrands would be quenched as soon as they made contact with the pans. The firebrands were subsequently dried and the sizes were measured using callipers and the dry mass was determined using a precision balance. For all experiments performed, the firebrands were cylindrical in shape. The average firebrand size measured from the 2.6-m Douglas-fir trees was 3 mm in diameter, 40 mm in length. The average firebrand size measured for the 5.2-m Douglas-fir trees was 4 mm in diameter with a length of 53 mm. The mass distribution of firebrands produced from two different tree sizes under similar tree moisture levels was similar. The only noticeable difference occurred in the largest mass class. Firebrands with masses up to 3.5 g to 3.7 g were observed for the larger tree height used (5.2 m). The surface area of the firebrands scaled with firebrand weight.},

The role of firebrands in fire propagation and the important parameters involved in spot fire development are studied. Historical large-scale fires, including wind-driven urban and wildland conflagrations and post-earthquake fires are given as examples. In addition, research on firebrand behaviour is reviewed. The phenomenon of spotting fires comprises three sequential mechanisms: generation, transport and ignition of recipient fuel. In order to understand these mechanisms, many experiments have been performed, such as measuring drag on firebrands, analysing the flow fields of flame and plume structures, collecting firebrands from burning materials, houses and wildfires, and observing firebrand burning characteristics in wind tunnels under the terminal velocity condition and ignition characteristics of fuel beds. The knowledge obtained from the experiments was used to develop firebrand models. Since Tarifa developed a firebrand model based on the terminal velocity approximation, many firebrand transport models have been developed to predict maximum spot fire distance. Combustion models of a firebrand were developed empirically and the maximum spot fire distance was found at the burnout limit. Recommendations for future research and development are provided.},

However, several aspects still require intense research activity towards a better design and optimization of industrial combustors, gasiﬁers and pyrolyzer. The objective of this work is to update the {CRECK} kinetic mechanism of biomass pyrolysis, allowing a better prediction of both yield and composition of the solid residue (biochar). Moreover, further model modiﬁcations allow to better describe the variability of hemicellulose in diﬀerent biomass. To this end, a large set of literature experimental data is collected and organized into a database, which is used to further tune and validate the proposed kinetic mechanism. Although the kinetic model maintains the previous agreement in respect of the rate of biomass pyrolysis, formation and distribution of gas and tar products, the novelty of this work is the greater attention to the predictions of biochar yield and composition, in a wide range of operative conditions. The model describes the solid residue as a mixture of pure carbon together with lumped metaplastic compounds, which represent the whole range of oxygenated and hydrogenated groups bonded to the carbonaceous matrix. These metaplastic species are released to the gas phase with their own kinetics and describe the change of both mass loss and elemental composition of the biochar. These comprehensive predictions of biochar composition are crucial for an accurate description of the successive oxidation and gasiﬁcation processes.},

To accurately model the response of oriented strand board to fire, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and microscale combustion calorimetry tests were carried out to construct a thermal decomposition model using a numerical solver, {ThermaKin}, and a hill climbing optimization algorithm. The model included a single-step water vaporization reaction and four consecutive reactions representing thermal decomposition of organic constituents of oriented strand board. The experiments and modeling revealed that the first two of the four reactions are endothermic, while the last two are exothermic. The net heat of decomposition was found to be near zero. The heat capacities of condensed-phase species and heats of combustion of evolved gases were also determined. The heats of combustion were found to vary over the course of decomposition—the trend captured by the model.

An important simplifying assumption made in early research into ember transport is the terminal-velocity assumption, in which embers are assumed to always fly at their terminal velocity relative to the wind field. With increases in computational power, it is now possible to directly simulate the atmospheric conditions resulting from wildfires and such simulations can resolve the larger of the turbulent processes involved. Because of the time-scales at which these processes occur, the terminal-velocity assumption may not be justified when modelling ember transport using these simulations. In this study we use a large eddy simulation of a turbulent plume to examine the validity of the terminal-velocity assumption when modelling the long-range transport of non-combusting embers. The results indicate that the use of the terminal-velocity assumption significantly overestimates the density of ember landings at long range, particularly for embers with higher terminal fall speeds.},

Wildfires that spread into communities, labeled as Wildland-Urban Interface ({WUI}) fires, are an example of large outdoor fires. Other examples of large outdoor fires are urban fires including those that may occur after earthquakes as well as in informal settlements. When vegetation and structures burn in large outdoor fires, pieces of burning material, known as firebrands, are generated, become lofted, and may be carried by the wind. This results in showers of wind-driven firebrands that may land ahead of the fire front, igniting vegetation and structures, and spreading the fire very fast. Post-fire disaster studies indicate that firebrand showers are a significant factor in the fire spread of multiple large outdoor fires. The present paper provides a comprehensive literature summary on the role of firebrand mechanisms on large outdoor fire spread. Experiments, models, and simulations related to firebrand generation, lofting, burning, transport, deposition, and ignition of materials are reviewed. Japan, a country that has been greatly influenced by ignition induced by firebrands that have resulted in severe large outdoor fires, is also highlighted here as most of this knowledge remains not available in the English language literature.

          Wildfires present a significant threat to ecosystems and human life, particularly as
global climate change amplifies the likelihood of extreme fire events. This study
develops a machine learning-based wildfire susceptibility model for Germany, using
data between 2003 and 2023. The primary goal is to identify the dominant wildfire
predictors and create monthly susceptibility maps. A Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm
was trained on remote sensing data and a comprehensive set of predictors, including
meteorological, terrain, and land cover variables. The results indicate that surface air
pressure, elevation, vegetation health, and proximity to urban areas are the most
important factors in predicting fire susceptibility. The model achieved 89\% accuracy,
demonstrating the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in wildfire risk modeling.
The monthly susceptibility map for July 2022 highlights northeastern Germany as
particularly vulnerable to fire outbreaks. The results offer valuable insights for targeted
wildfire prevention and resource allocation, emphasizing the importance of both
temporal and spatial dimensions in managing wildfire risks.},

	abstract = {Firebrands are critical in spreading fires by potentially causing secondary spot fires when dispersed by fire plumes and wind, and deposited into combustible materials. This paper is on the simulations of dispersion and deposition of firebrands by a round turbulent jet and their validation against the previous experimental data (Wadhwani et. al 2017). Firebrands were non-burning with cubiform and cylindrical shapes. Simulations were conducted by Fire Dynamic Simulator ({FDS}) with the large eddy simulation ({LES}) of turbulence representing the subgrid scales by the Modified Deardorff model and the particle Lagrangian tracking of dispersed firebrands. This took the translational motion into account but not the rotational motion for particles. First, simulations were performed without particles for free turbulent planar and round jets to validate the {FDS} flow solver in these configurations. For both jets, although the simulated mean velocities overall conformed to their respective self-similar profiles, the planer jet mean velocity displayed more consistency with these profiles. In both jets, the difference between the simulated Reynolds stresses and their previously measured values by others were within 30\%. Then, simulations were preformed with firebrands in a computational configuration resembling the experimental firebrand generator setup of Wadhwani et. al (2017). Since the number of simulated firebrands was limited (210 particles), an accurate calculation of the landed firebrand distribution was not possible. However, the deposited cubiform firebrand pattern seemed to be more consistent with the previous experimental and simulation results than the deposited cylindrical firebrands. This may be attributed to the fact that the neglect of rotational motion was more critical to cylindrical firebrands.},
