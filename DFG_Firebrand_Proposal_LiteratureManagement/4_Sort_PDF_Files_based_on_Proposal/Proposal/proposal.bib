 abstract = {Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000--2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({$>$}1 {$\sigma$}) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for {$\sim$}55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984--2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

 abstract = {Source terms of the number of firebrands released as trees/shrubs torch are essential for helping to more accurately implement detailed physics-based models of wildfire propagation, particularly when torching occurs. A key challenge in estimating these source terms is the difficulty in measuring firebrand generation rates from the source. Typical studies have reported generation characteristics (firebrands/m               2               ), but enumeration of the total number of firebrands released has remained elusive. Recently, a fire-resistant fabric was successfully employed to quantify ``hot'' firebrands (i.e., can potentially lead to further fire spread) generated during tree-scale burns. In this paper, a total of 71 tree/shrubs were burned to quantify hot firebrand production statistics for Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and sagebrush. A network of 65 fire-resistant fabric stations were deployed during the burns to measure the ``hot'' firebrands that are released. These stations are placed strategically at several radii and angles in the prominent wind direction. Using the number of firebrands determined from the fabric, a first-order extrapolation method was developed and evaluated to estimate the source terms (i.e., total number of hot firebrands released). Variation in the firebrand production with the height of the trees and for three species is reported. The total number of hot firebrands produced typically increased with the height of the tree/shrub burned as expected. The specific hot firebrand production (firebrands produced per kg dry mass burned) is exponentially dependent on the moisture content of the tree and had an inconclusive correlation with the height of the trees. Overall, for trees of comparable moisture content, sagebrush produced higher specific hot firebrands when compared to ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir species.},

Additionally, the flame height, tree mass decay, vertical flow velocity, and temperature at the top of the trees were measured during the experiments. The relationship between the various parameters was analyzed and a good connection was found. The specimens burnt were mostly young trees, so large particles (e.g., pine cones, thick trunk barks, branches) were not included in this study as they were not present. Actually, the firebrands produced in the laboratory tests, mainly burning leaves, had a cross-sectional area of \&lt;1,600 mm               2               , having the potential to cause short distance spotting (up to tens of meters). Quercus trees are often considered to have a lower fire risk than eucalyptus or pine trees. However, in this study,               Quercus suber               and               Quercus robur               were the species that produced more firebrands, both in terms of number and total volume. The tests with               Quercus suber               were the only ones using specimens from an adult tree, confirming the great importance of the age of trees in the propensity to release firebrands. The results obtained with               Quercus robur               confirmed the high tendency of this species to originate spot fires at a short distance. Thus, these results are of great relevance to afforestation plans and to evaluating the risk of the presence of these species in wildland--urban interface areas.},

Simulations were carried out in a turbulent boundary layer with a free stream wind velocity of 18.8\,m/s, an initial boundary layer height of 25\,m, with firebrand densities of 70, 230, and 570\,kg/m3 and release heights of 20\,m and 40\,m. Identical firebrands were consecutively released under identical initial conditions after the turbulent flow reached a statistically stationary state. The motion and deposition locations of firebrands were characterized by tracking tens of thousands of firebrands in each simulation and computing statistical quantities such as dispersion and diffusion of flying firebrands, and the joint probability density function of the coordinates of the deposited firebrands. For all simulated cases, the distribution of deposited firebrands exhibited symmetry in the spanwise direction. The normalized mean position of the deposited firebrands in the streamwise direction increased approximately by a factor of two when the density of firebrands decreased from 570\,kg/m3 to 70\,kg/m3. Also, the ground distribution of firebrands that were released from a higher elevation was found more leptokurtic with a multivariate kurtosis deviating more than 5\% of that of a normal distribution.},

The breakage model is parameterized by fuel density and strength data that are experimentally generated. Dimensionless parameters are identified to characterize the degradation and breakage processes. The breakage model is then coupled to a plume model to form a description of the breakage, transport, and mass loss of branching vegetative fuel packets in wildland fire scenarios.

@article{Bean2021,
 abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The increasing occurrence of severe wildfires, coupled with the expansion of the wildland urban interface has increased the number of structures in danger of being destroyed by wildfires. Ignition by firebrands is a significant avenue for fire spread and structure loss; thus, understanding processes and parameters that control the ignition of fuel beds by firebrands is important for reducing these losses. In this study the effect of fuel bed characteristics (i.e., particle size and porous or solid fuel bed) on ignition behavior was considered. Modelling and analysis was conducted to better understand parameters that are dominant in controlling ignition. The fuel beds, made from Douglas-fir shavings, Douglas-fir plates, or cardboard plates, were heated with a cartridge heater (i.e., surrogate firebrand) to observe ignition. Smaller particles were observed to ignite more readily in porous beds than larger particles when heat transfer from the heater is primarily through conduction. This occurs in large part due to differences in contact area between the fuel bed and the heater coupled with thermal properties of the fuel bed. As particle sizes increased, ignition was more likely to occur at extended times (\&gt;100 s) due to the increased importance of radiation heat transfer. Douglas-fir plates were primarily observed to ignite at times where conduction was the dominant mode of heat transfer (\&lt;10 s). Heat flux delivered to the fuel bed was observed to be a more accurate predictor of ignition likelihood and ignition time than heater temperatures. The characteristic ratio of transport and chemical timescales can be used, in conjunction with the measured heat flux and thermal diffusivity of the fuel beds, as a first approximation to predict ignition for the porous fuel beds. This suggests that future work focusing on these parameters may produce a general characterization of fuel bed ignition probability across fuel beds materials and morphologies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Flight dispersion, deposition, and smoldering state of tens of thousands of individual mass and size-changing firebrands were investigated in the atmospheric boundary layer turbulence, which was obtained using Large-eddy simulations. Firebrands were assumed to be smoldering spherical particles of Stokes numbers ranging from 30 to 175. Results indicate that the presence of urban topography significantly affects the firebrand flight behavior, landing distribution, and risk of spotting. Compared to a case with flat topography, horizontal dispersions of the smallest size firebrands were significantly enhanced when urban topography was presented, while the largest firebrands landed closer to each other and closer to the release point. Consequently, a notably different and more compact spotting risk map was achieved. Within the urban boundary layer turbulence, firebrands had a shorter flight and smoldering times in comparison with the flat case. As a result, firebrands landed with larger temperatures, which contributed to a higher risk of spotting in the presence of urban topography.},

Therefore, in this study, a novel work of encompassing a wide range of factors attributing to the recent bushfires is presented. Empirical evidence-based statistical methods are used to identify the hydroclimatic variables and geomorphic characteristics contributing to the 2019--2020 bushfires. The results highlight that ongoing drought, surface soil moisture (SSM), wind speed (WS10), relative humidity (RH), heat waves (HW), dead and live fuel moisture, and certain land cover types create favorable conditions for fire ignition and aid in fire propagation in different regions of the NSW state. The findings suggest that accounting for the above-identified variables in bushfire prediction and monitoring system are crucial in avoiding such catastrophes in the future.

 abstract = {{$<$}div class="section abstract"{$><$}div class="htmlview paragraph"{$>$}Renewable fuels, such as bio- and e-fuels, are of great interest for the defossilization of the transport sector. Among these fuels, methanol represents a promising candidate for emission reduction and efficiency increase due to its very high knock resistance and its production pathway as e-fuel. In general, reliable simulation tools are mandatory for evaluating a specific fuel potential and optimizing combustion systems. In this work, a previously presented methodology (Esposito et al., Energies, 2020) has been refined and applied to a different engine and different fuels. Experimental data measured with a single cylinder engine (SCE) are used to validate RANS 3D-CFD simulations of gaseous engine-out emissions. The RANS 3D-CFD model has been used for operation with a toluene reference fuel (TRF) gasoline surrogate and methanol. Varying operating conditions with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and air dilution are considered for the two fuels. The laminar flame speed for the fuels has been tabulated by means of detailed chemistry 1D-flame calculations. The G-equation model is used to simulate flame propagation in combination with chemical kinetics to estimate the emission species correctly. The resulting G-equation calibration is compared between the two fuels. Emission results are analyzed, validated with experiments, and compared between the two fuels. The methodology shows a good overall predictivity regarding trends and absolute values. Simulated carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) shows to be mainly within a 4 \% deviation from the measurements. Oxygen (O\textsubscript{2}) deviations are within 3 \% at lean operation and higher at stoichiometric conditions due to the low overall oxygen content. The maximum nitrogen oxides (NO\textsubscript{x}) deviation for the TRF is 22 \%, while higher deviations are observed for methanol up to 42.3 \%. Total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions are mainly below 20 \% deviation. Higher carbon monoxide (CO) deviations are observed due to high CO sensitivity to mixture formation prediction, even if the trends with EGR and air dilution are correctly reproduced. Overall, the methodology shows good potential for virtual pollutant evaluation, assessment of emission reduction strategies, and development of engines with methanol fuel.{$<$}/div{$><$}/div{$>$}},

The ambient wind plays an important role in smouldering ignition of wildland fuels by firebrands, but its influence is poorly stated. In this work, the effect of ambient wind on the ignition of a moist pine needle fuel bed by a glowing firebrand was investigated. Two ignition outcomes, smouldering or failed ignition, were observed. Wind was found to have a significant impact on the ignition process by affecting the glowing combustion state of the firebrand. As the wind velocity increased from zero to 4 m/s, the smouldering ignition probability firstly increased and then decreased, while the smouldering ignition delay time decreased. Under the same wind conditions, the ignition probability decreased while the smouldering ignition delay time increased as the fuel moisture content increased from 5.9\% to 53.2\%. A theoretical model based on the glowing combustion rate of firebrand and heat transfer between the firebrand and the fuel bed under the effect of wind was proposed. The model predicted the variation trend of the smoldering ignition delay time with the wind velocity well when FMC was less than 20\%, but poor at higher FMC. It also predicted that the square root of ignition delay time had a good linear relationship with FMC. This work is a step forward in understanding of spot fires initiated by glowing firebrands.},

 abstract = {Wildland and Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) fires are an important problem in many areas of the world and may have major consequences in terms of safety, air quality, and damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the ecosystem. It is expected that with climate changes the wildland fire and WUI fire problem will only intensify. The spot fire ignition of a wildland fire by hot (solid, molten or burning) metal fragments/sparks and firebrands (flaming or glowing embers) is an important fire ignition pathway by which wildfires, WUI fires, and fires in industrial settings are started and may propagate. There are numerous cases reported of wildfires started by hot metal particles from clashing power-lines, or generated by machines, grinding and welding. Once the wildfire or structural fire has been ignited and grows, it can spread rapidly through ember spotting, where pieces of burning material (e.g. branches, bark, building materials, etc.) are lofted by the plume of the fire and then transported forward by the wind landing where they can start spot fires downwind. The spot fire problem can be separated in several individual processes: the generation of the particles (metal or firebrand) and their thermochemical state; their flight by plume lofting and wind drag and the particle thermo-chemical change during the flight; the onset of ignition (smoldering or flaming) of the fuel after the particle lands on the fuel; and finally, the sustained ignition and burning of the combustible material. Here an attempt has been made to summarize the state of the art of the wildfire spotting problem by describing the distinct individual processes involved in the problem and by discussing their know-how status. Emphasis is given to those areas that the author is more familiar with, due to his work on the subject. By characterizing these distinct individual processes, it is possible to attain the required information to develop predictive, physics-base wildfire spotting models. Such spotting models, together with topographical maps and wind models, could be added to existing flame spread models to improve the predictive capabilities of landscape-scale wildland fire spread models. These enhanced wildland fire spread models would provide land managers and government agencies with better tools to prescribe preventive measures and fuels treatments before a fire, and allocate suppression resources and issue evacuation orders during a fire.},

 abstract = {This paper represents a study on the characterization of firebrand production which was carried out, using experimental fires conducted as prescribed fires in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, USA in March of 2013--2015. Several preliminary techniques were tested to characterize the firebrand production. Firebrands were collected from three plots for each year and analyzed for mass and size distribution. Thermal imagery was used to measure the velocity, size and number of firebrands in 2014 and 2015. The distribution of firebrands was evaluated in a monitored volume during the experiment. It was found that not less than 70\% of collected particles were bark fragments and the rest were pine and shrub branches. The number of firebrands decreases with increasing the cross section area of firebrands. The mass of the particles varied from 5 to 50mg, and the maximum number of the particles was observed for the mass range of 10--20mg. About 80\% of firebrands were particles with the cross section area of (5--20) {\texttimes} 10-5 m2. These results are consistent with the available observations of real fires [1], [2]. Processing of infrared video showed that starting from a distance of 13m from fire front, an increasing number of firebrands were observed in a controlled volume, increasing in number up to 180 per second. Relationships describing the time-variation of the number of particles that dropped on a 1.4m2 surface and the number of particles that flew through a 1m3 volume were obtained. Comparing the experimental and calculated data, we can conclude that these relationships allow us to describe the two numbers with an acceptable accuracy (adj. R2 0.74 and 0.86, respectively). In addition, the velocity of the particles, which depended on the wind velocity, was in the 0.1--10.5m/s range, with an average value of 2.5m/s.},

A quantitative understanding of the short distance spotting dynamics, namely the firebrand density distribution within a distance from the fire front and how distinct fires coalesce in a highly turbulent environment, is still lacking. To address this, a custom software was developed in order to detect the location and the number of flying firebrands in a thermal image then determine the temperature and sizes of each firebrand. The software consists of two modules, the detector and the tracker. The detector determines the location of the firebrands in the frame, and the tracker compares the firebrand in different frames and determines the identification number of each firebrand. Comparison of the calculated results with the data obtained by the independent experts and experimental data showed that the maximum relative error does not exceed 12\% for the low and medium number of firebrands in the frame (less than 30) and software agrees well with experimental observations for firebrands\,{$>$}\,20\,{\texttimes}\,10-5 m. It was found that fireline intensity below 12,590~kW~m-1 does not change significantly 2D firebrand flux for firebrands bigger than 20\,{\texttimes}\,10-5 m, while occasional crowning can increase the firebrand flux in several times. The developed software allowed us to analyse the thermograms obtained during the field experiments and to measure the velocities, sizes and temperatures of the firebrands. It will help to better understand of how the firebrands can ignite the surrounding fuel beds and could be an important tool in investigating fire propagation in communities.},

Human activities and fire weather conditions favouring ignitions and propagation have always been the drivers of such fires but anthropogenic climate change alongside the extension of wildland-urban interface (WUI) that concentrates both assets and fire ignitions have the compounding effect of exacerbating fire risk. WUI are currently not adequately prepared to sustain events whose frequency and intensity are foreseen to increase in the future as shown during the extreme fires that occurred recently in Euro-Mediterranean countries. This work presents the context of WUI fires in the Euro-Mediterranean region, their driving forces and their impacts on society, with insights from three recent catastrophic fires that drew much attention. In this context, we propose a conceptual framework for understanding the WUI issue assessing the implications for fire risk and providing some guidance to mitigate this risk, updated management strategies as well as comments about gaps in our current knowledge and how we might address this problem in the future. A successful approach to reduce fire risk in the future will require building resilient landscapes and communities better prepared to face these extreme fire events in which WUI population, forest managers, land planners, civil protection, and policy-makers need to work together to improve the safety and resilience of these fire-prone areas.},

@article{Hajilou2021,
 abstract = {Over the past few years, numerous large-scale disasters have occurred due to wildfires at the wildland-urban interface (WUI). In these fires, spread via the transport of firebrands (burning embers) plays a significant role. Several models have been developed to describe the transport of firebrands but few, if any, are available which can provide a quantitative means to generate firebrands at the source of a fire. In this regard, a new methodology is proposed here that uses a wind tunnel to experimentally quantify the generation of firebrands from WUI fuels under different ambient conditions. The setup allows for the collection of all generated solid firebrands and major downstream gaseous species concentrations. Unique firebrand yield correlations can then be generated for each tested fuel, while also accounting for the heat-release rate, providing unique validation targets for numerical simulations. Generation of firebrands from branches of two conifers at a fixed wind speed of 4~m/s are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of this new methodology. A carbon mass balance was utilized to analyze preliminary results and understand how much of the fuel mass transitions to firebrands vs. gases. These results provide a description of the mass burning process and ultimately tie firebrand production to a time-dependent heat-release rate for initialization of firebrand transport in numerical simulations. An average firebrand yield ranging from 3--4\% of initial dry mass is ultimately presented for lodgepole pine and Douglas fir. Future work is required with larger fuel sizes pertaining to real wildfire scenarios; however, the presented methodology can provide valuable data needed to initialize numerical simulations of firebrand transport, necessary for reconstruction of WUI fires and to aid in the development of mitigation strategies for the prevention of future disasters.},

To understand the mechanism of these losses, small-scale experiments designed to capture heating from firebrand piles and to describe the process of ignition were conducted using laboratory-fabricated cylindrical wooden firebrands. Two heat flux measurement methods were compared, and the influences of firebrand diameter, pile mass, and wind on heating from firebrand piles were explored. Diameter had little effect on heating, pile mass a moderate effect, and wind a large effect. Peak heat fluxes showed distinct differences between heat fluxes produced by firebrand piles as opposed to individual firebrands, which have been studied exclusively on the small-scale in the past. Above a critical mass, piles did not produce higher heat fluxes; however, they heated fuels for an increasingly longer duration and over a larger area. Water-cooled heat flux gauges provided reliable heat flux measurements for large firebrand piles and an array of thin-skin calorimeters indicated significant spatial variation in heat flux. A recipient fuel transitioned from smoldering to flaming under an adequate wind speed soon after a firebrand pile was deposited on its surface.},

Many experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of the firebrand attacks on structures and to identify possible solutions. The experimental facility consists of a firebrand generator coupled to a wind tunnel. The wind speed in the firebrand generator is relatively low, in order to assure a quality continuous flow of glowing firebrands. On the contrary, the wind speed in the wind tunnel is high to duplicate actual firebrand attacks. Previous works show a highly turbulent region above the entrance of firebrands to the wind tunnel which is formed because of the velocity difference and penetration of firebrand entrance hose into the wind tunnel. The penetration is required to provide a uniform firebrand distribution along the height of the test section. In this computational work, the influence of the height of the entrance hose, its orientation respect to the tunnel and the distance between the coupling port and the test section are analyzed. The optimized results are presented and discussed for a variety of wind speeds within the wind tunnel and the firebrand generator.},

Limited details have been released about the methodology for characterizing firebrands such as the proper sample size and the measurement process. This study focuses on (1) finding the minimum required sample size to represents the characteristics of the population, and (2) proposes a framework to facilitate the tedious measurement process. To achieve these goals, several firebrand generation tests were conducted at a boundary layer wind tunnel with realistic gusty wind traces. Firebrands were generated from burning structural fuels and collected in 46 strategically located water pans. The statistical analysis showed that the minimum required sample size based on the chosen statistical parameters (standard deviation, confidence interval, and margin of error) is 1,400 for each test. To facilitate characterizing such a large sample of firebrands, an automated image processing algorithm to measure the projected area of the firebrands was developed, which can automatically detect the edges of the background sheet, rotate the photo if its tilted before cropping, detect edges of firebrands, remove erroneous particles (e.g., ash) and finally measures the projected area. To facilitate the weighing process, a Gaussian process regression was performed to predict the mass based on projected area, traveling distance and wind speed. The model can predict the firebrand mass within 5\% error compared to the measurement. This framework and model can provide a probabilistic range of firebrand characteristics over the continuous range of the collection region.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Within the scope of the work presented herein, a type of Thin Skin Calorimeter (TSC) was developed intending for a practical, low cost device enabling the cost-effective mass production required for characterising the thermal boundary conditions during multiple large-scale fire tests. The technical description of the TSC design and a formulation of the proposed calibration technique are presented. This methodology allows for the quantification of irradiation by means of an a posteriori analysis based on a temperature measurement from the TSC, a temperature measurement of the gas-phase in the vicinity of the TSC and a correction factor defined during a pre-test calibration process. The proposed calibration methodology is designed to account for uncertainties inherent to the simplicity of the irradiation measurement technique, therefore not requiring precise information regarding material thermal and optical properties. This methodology is designed and presented so as to enable adaption of the technique to meet the specific requirements of other experimental setups. This is conveyed by means of an example detailing the design and calibration of a device designed for a series of large-scale experiments as part of the `Real Fires for the Safe Design of Tall Buildings' project.},

To describe the transition of the half-width of the cross section, the temperature elevation, and the velocity of fire plumes along the trajectory, a similarity model was derived by dimensional analysis. This model is equivalent to that in a quiescent environment, with the cross-wind effect embodied in the distance along the trajectory. Therefore, the derived model reasonably correlated the half-width of the cross section with the temperature elevation. It also obtained the measured temperature elevation at ground level (0.02\,m above the floor) downwind of the fire sources. In this evaluation, the correlation between the measured and computed data points was improved by introducing a virtual source that considered both the fire source size and the cross-wind velocity effects.},

However, the large probabilistic variability in its generation, transport, and ignition processes causes difficulty in quantifying its risk. In this study, a series of wind tunnel experiments was conducted to understand the probabilistically varying characteristics of two among three processes involved in spot ignition, i.e., the generation and transport of firebrands. Analysis samples were generated by combusting a wood crib in an apparatus that simulates the behavior of a fully developed structural fire. The experimental parameters were the ejection height of firebrands, H, crosswind velocity, U{$\infty$}, and thickness of wood stick used for assembling the wood crib, d. Utilizing the experimental results, the projected area of a firebrand and its transport distance downwind of a fire source were formulated based on simple physical considerations. However, because the obtained correlations represent deterministic relationships of the parameters, they were further incorporated into probability distributions (a truncated exponential distribution for the projected area and a truncated normal distribution for the transport distance) to enable the consideration of intrinsic variations. The obtained models reasonably reproduced the experimental results for both the projected area and transport distance. Although structural fire is the targeted type of fire source, the proposed models exhibit forms extensible to other types of fire sources.},

In this study, in order to predict the scattering of firebrands in an urban fire, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD), turbulent combustion model, radiation model, and firebrand scattering model are coupled and it is validated by a fire wind tunnel experiment. The density, terminal velocity, and Stokes diameters of firebrands which are necessary for the firebrand scattering model are measured. The ratio of Stokes diameter to equivalent diameter is focused on 0.2---0.7. An urban fire simulation in a modeled urban area has been conducted using the coupled model and the firebrand experimental data. It is found that when the inflow wind velocity is comparatively slow, the size of the thermal plume becomes significant, and when the inflow wind velocity is high, the thermal plume is suppressed and greatly inclines to the leeward side, which increases the risk of the fire spreading to neighboring buildings. Firebrands can be scattered over 400 m. Firebrands are blown up by the thermal plume and the scattering distances are influenced by the background flow field, the magnitude of thermal plume, and the Stokes diameters of firebrands.},

 abstract = {Spot fires caused by lofted embers (i.e. firebrands) can be a significant factor in the spread of wildfires. Embers can be especially dangerous near the wildland--urban interface (WUI) because of the potential for the fire to be spread near or on structures. This work sought to identify how ember generation changes for different fuel characteristics and environmental conditions. Samples were burned in a heated wind tunnel and the time required for the ember(s) to form was measured using a DSLR camera. A factorial analysis of variance was used to determine the sensitivity of the time to generation to species, diameter, moisture content, fuel condition (i.e. dowel v. natural sample), crossflow temperature and crossflow velocity. Four fuel species were evaluated: Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and white oak (Quercus alba). The diameter of the samples had the greatest effect on the time to generation and the fuel species had the second greatest effect. The small diameter samples were relatively insensitive to changes in other parameters. Natural samples required significantly longer time than dowels to generate an ember. These conclusions suggest that fuel morphology is one of the most significant factors influencing ember generation.},

 abstract = {Wildland fires that spread into developed areas, i.e., the wildland-urban interface (WUI), have resulted in numerous disasters over the past few decades, claiming the lives of civilians and causing large-scale property destruction. In these communities, fires often ignite structures by the deposition of small burning embers (firebrand attack) which is unique to these fires and not yet well understood. This study quantifies the in-flight thermal characteristics of firebrands generated by three typical vegetative fuels, namely stone pine, eucalyptus and oak found in the WUI, inside a lab-scale wind tunnel. The effects of fuel characteristics (i.e., species, moisture content and twig diameter) and ambient condition (i.e., crosswind speed) on surface temperature, number generation rate (NGR), and heat release rate (HRRfb) were investigated. Firebrand surface temperatures, measured using ratio pyrometry, were insensitive to fuel moisture content and mean twig diameter but higher at higher crosswind speeds. Surface temperature was used to estimate the HRRfb of each firebrand based on a surface energy balance and compared to overall emissions measurements. While ratio pyrometry best captured firebrand temperatures, infrared video worked well to track firebrands and derive a NGR as a function of time. Correlations were used to organize the NGR, HRRfb, and mass generation rate (MGR) under different test conditions, and unique correlations were derived for each fuel species. Results showed that the peak NGRs and MGRs for all three fuel species were positively related to crosswind speed but negatively related to fuel moisture content and mean twig diameter. The experimental data, correlations and methods disclosed in this study are important to understand the influence of competing processes on firebrand generation, parameterize fire spread models for time-dependent generation, and improve estimates of downstream ignition potential. Experiments must later be validated against large-scale data before widespread application.},

 abstract = {Spotfires are a major problem in bushfire management, greatly complicate suppression efforts, and contribute to fires breaking control lines. Firebrands are often implicated in structure loss, and in extreme circumstances have been observed to ignite new fires over 30km ahead of the parent fire. Existing prediction techniques do not accommodate the problem of such long-range spotting, and the meteorological and fire conditions that lead to such events are not well understood. We present a computationally inexpensive, physically based model of ember transport within bushfire plumes, with four components: an integral plume model, a model of turbulence within the plume, a probabilistic model of ember transport by the plume, and a model of transport beneath the plume. The predicted ember landing distributions from this model compare satisfactorily to the explicit ember-transport calculations of Thurston et al. (2017) and to observations (Cruz et al., 2012). We examine the sensitivity of the simple model to its input parameters. The 90th percentile of spotting distance increases with increasing fire power and decreases with increasing ember terminal fall velocity and fire radius. Where there is a meteorological inversion or stable layer and the plume updraft is sufficiently strong to carry embers to that height, the stable layer substantially limits the transport distance, with increased height favoring longer-range transport. The effect of wind speed is complex, due to the competing factors of faster horizontal transport but suppressed vertical plume development with stronger winds.},

 abstract = {Spotting ignition by lofted firebrands is a significant mechanism of fire spread, as observed in many large-scale fires. The role of firebrands in fire propagation and the important parameters involved in spot fire development are studied. Historical large-scale fires, including wind-driven urban and wildland conflagrations and post-earthquake fires are given as examples. In addition, research on firebrand behaviour is reviewed. The phenomenon of spotting fires comprises three sequential mechanisms: generation, transport and ignition of recipient fuel. In order to understand these mechanisms, many experiments have been performed, such as measuring drag on firebrands, analysing the flow fields of flame and plume structures, collecting firebrands from burning materials, houses and wildfires, and observing firebrand burning characteristics in wind tunnels under the terminal velocity condition and ignition characteristics of fuel beds. The knowledge obtained from the experiments was used to develop firebrand models. Since Tarifa developed a firebrand model based on the terminal velocity approximation, many firebrand transport models have been developed to predict maximum spot fire distance. Combustion models of a firebrand were developed empirically and the maximum spot fire distance was found at the burnout limit. Recommendations for future research and development are provided.},

In this study, methane is used as supplement to liquid diesel fuel due to its benefits like high knock resistance and clean combustion. A deep understanding of the in-cylinder process is required for engine design and combustion controller development. To investigate the impact of different input parameters such as injection duration, injection timing, and substitution rate on varying output parameters like load, combustion phasing, and engine-out emissions, numerous investigations were conducted. Engine speed, global equivalence ratio, and injection pressure were held constant. The experiments were carried out in a modified single-cylinder compression ignition engine. The results reveal regimes with different dependencies between injection timing of diesel fuel and combustion phasing. This work demonstrates the potential of the diesel-dual-fuel concept by combining sophisticated combustion control with the favorable combustion mode. Without employing exhaust gas recirculation, TIER IMO 3 emissions limits are met while ensuring high thermal efficiency.},

Flame structure, local gas temperature as well as local soot volume fraction and primary soot particle diameter, are simultaneously detected by means of OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence (nTLAF) of indium, and time-resolved (TiRe) laser-induced incandescence (LII), respectively. The collected data sets were used to generate joint statistics of soot properties and flame characteristics and provided new insights into the interaction of the OH layer and soot in turbulent flames. The interaction of OH and soot as a driving mechanism for soot oxidation is of particular interest as it has been proven to be challenging to model. Statistics of soot volume fraction and primary particle size in the OH layer are employed to gain deeper insights into the soot oxidation process. Mean soot volume fraction and primary soot particle size conditioned on temperature and OH signal intensity indicate that, due to differential diffusion of soot with respect to the chemical species, high soot volume fraction and primary soot particle diameter of up to 50 nm are present at low temperatures and low OH concentration. In the soot oxidation region, statistical analysis of the soot parameters disclose that clusters of high soot volume fraction mostly consist of large primary particles. Observations from instantaneous images and the presence of large primary particles inside the OH layer suggest that the oxidation is not sufficiently fast to burn the soot completely.},

In this research, an experimental and analytical effort was conducted to determine the variable relationships that control firebrand burning. A series of experiments were performed to quantify the mass loss rate, temperature, and char diameter change with time for single and arrays of cylindrical firebrands. An analytical model was developed to predict the time dependent burning of firebrands including ash accumulation in forced flow conditions. Six different methods for predicting char oxidation were included in the model to identify the best approach for predicting firebrand burning. Based on the simulation results, the model with char oxidation determined using the heat and mass transfer Reynolds analogy provided the best results with predicted temperatures, char diameter, and mass loss rates within 5\%, 4\%, and 29\% of the single firebrand test data, respectively. Higher differences were predicted with arrays of firebrands, which was attributed to the complex flow field that develops around the firebrands. Analysis of the analytical equations was used to identify the variable relationships affecting firebrand temperature, mass loss rate, char diameter, and burning duration.},

 abstract = {Forest fire is a critical disaster that causes massive destruction of forest ecosystem and economic loss. Hence, accurate estimation of the burned area is important for evaluation of the degree of damage and for preparing baseline data for recovery. Since most of the area size damaged by wildfires in Korea is less than 1 ha, it is necessary to use satellite or drone images with a resolution of less than 10m for detecting the damage area. This paper aims to detect wildfire-damaged area from a Kompsat-3 image using the indices such as NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and FBI (fire burn index) and to examine the classification characteristics according to the methods such as Otsu thresholding and ISODATA(iterative self-organizing data analysis technique). To mitigate the salt-and-pepper phenomenon of the pixel-based classification, a gaussian filter was applied to the images of NDVI and FBI. Otsu thresholding and ISODATA could distinguish the burned forest from normal forest appropriately, and the salt-and-pepper phenomenon at the boundaries of burned forest was reduced by the gaussian filter. The result from ISODATA with gaussian filter using NDVI was closest to the official record of damage area (56.9 ha) published by the Korea Forest Service. Unlike Otsu thresholding for binary classification,since the ISODATA categorizes the images into multiple classes such as(1)severely burned area, (2) moderately burned area, (3) mixture of burned and unburned areas, and (4) unburned area, the characteristics of the boundaries consisting of burned and normal forests can be better expressed. It is expected that our approach can be utilized for the high-resolution images obtained from other satellites and drones.},

 abstract = {Spotting ignition by firebrands is a significant fire spread pathway at the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where mulch products are commonly used as landscaping materials. Mulch is typically organic in nature, thus it may be easily ignited into a smoldering mode by firebrands and subsequently transition to flaming, leading to direct flame contact and radiant heat exposure to siding materials of adjacent structures. This work quantified the thresholds of smoldering ignition of four common types of commercially available mulch (black mulch (BM), forest floor (FF), redwood (RW), and fir bark (FB)) exposed to heating by smoldering firebrand piles, and their propensity for smoldering-to-flaming transition under external winds (up to 1.4~m/s). We found that there was a minimum mass of firebrand pile to achieve smoldering ignition of mulch (e.g., {$\sim$}0.1~g for FF). Beyond this minimum mass, the required wind speed to trigger smoldering ignition generally decreased as the mass of the firebrand pile increased, agreeing well with theoretical analysis. After smoldering ignition, smoldering-to-flaming transition could be observed when the wind speed exceeded a critical value (e.g., {$\sim$}1~m/s for FF), which was not affected by the initial spotting process. To achieve smoldering-to-flaming transition, the glowing mulch had to reach a critical temperature of around 850~{$^\circ$}C. Mulch samples with larger particle sizes were more likely to smolder and transition to flaming, due to increased oxygen supply through larger inter-particle pores and channels and better firebrand accumulation due to a more crevice-like geometry on the fuel surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of the ignition and burning behavior of landscaping mulches, and thus contributes to the prevention of extreme WUI fire events.},

The study was carried out by physics based modeling where the wind flow turbulence was dealt with by large eddy simulation (LES) and firebrands were treated by Lagrangian tracking. The Lagrangian equations coupled with the flow solver, accounted for both translational and rotational motions as well as thermochemical degradation of firebrands, assumed to be cylindrical. The dimensions of the structure were varied from 3 to 9~m in the simulations for a parametric study. The simulations were carried out by tracking many firebrands randomly released with a uniform distribution from a horizontal plane 35~m above the ground into the computational domain. The coordinates of the deposited firebrands were used to calculate their normalized number density (number of landed firebrands per unit surface area) to quantify their deposition pattern. On the leewardside of the block, an area, referred to as the safe zone, was identified right behind the structure where firebrands never deposit. The size of the safe zone in the direction perpendicular to the wind was nearly identical to the width of the structure. The length of the safe zone in the wind direction was proportional to the height of the structure. The leeward face of the blocks was never hit by a firebrand. The windward face was hit by many more firebrands than the lateral faces but much less than the top face. The distribution of the number density of the deposited firebrands on the top face was found to be correlated with the flow separation and reattachment on this face.},

 abstract = {Attempting to experimentally quantify the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from firebrand showers has remained elusive. The coupling of two facilities has begun to unravel this difficult problem. The NIST Firebrand Generator (NIST Dragon) is an experimental device that can generate a firebrand shower in a safe and repeatable fashion. Since wind plays a critical role in the spread of WUI fires in the USA and urban fires in Japan, NIST has established collaboration with the Building Research Institute (BRI) in Japan. BRI maintains one of the only full scale wind tunnel facilities in the world designed specifically for fire experimentation; the Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility (FRWTF). The present investigation is aimed at extensively quantifying firebrand penetration through building vents using full scale tests. A structure was placed inside the FRWTF and firebrand showers were directed at the structure using the NIST Dragon. The structure was fitted with a generic building vent, consisting of only a frame fitted with a metal mesh. Six different mesh sizes openings were used for testing. Behind the mesh, four different materials were placed to ascertain whether the firebrands that were able to penetrate the building mesh assembly could ignite these materials. Reduced scale test methods afford the capability to test new vent technologies and may serve as the basis for new standard testing methodologies. As a result, a new experimental facility developed at NIST is presented and is known as the NIST Dragon's LAIR (Lofting and Ignition Research). The NIST Dragon's LAIR has been developed to simulate a wind driven firebrand attack at reduced scale. The facility consists of a reduced scale Firebrand Generator (Baby Dragon) coupled to a bench scale wind tunnel. Finally, a series of full scale experiments were conducted to visualize the flow of firebrands around obstacles placed downstream of the NIST Dragon. Firebrands were observed to accumulate in front of these obstacles at a stagnation plane, as was observed when the structure was used for firebrand penetration through building vent experiments, due to flow recirculation. The accumulation of firebrands at a stagnation plane presents a severe threat to ignitable materials placed near structures.},

 abstract = {Several studies suggest that the firebrands are a major cause of structural ignition of Wildland--Urban Interface fires in USA and Australia. For 40 years, past firebrand studies have focused on how far firebrands fly and do not assess the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from firebrand showers. The development of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Dragon has allowed the quantification of structure ignition vulnerabilities of full-scale building assemblies. Full-scale tests are necessary to highlight vulnerabilities of structures to ignition under firebrand attack, whereas bench-scale test methods afford the capability to test new firebrand-resistant technologies and may serve as the basis for new standard testing methodologies. To this end, the present investigation was undertaken to construct a new and improved Dragon's Lofting and Ignition Research facility. This entailed removing the NIST Baby Dragon from the wind tunnel facility and inserting the new and improved NIST continuous feed Baby Dragon. The unique feature of the continuous feed Baby Dragon, over the current NIST Baby Dragon, is the capability to produce a constant firebrand shower in order to expose building materials to continual firebrand bombardment. The efficacy of the new experimental facility to determine ignition regime maps of building materials exposed to wind-driven firebrand showers is presented. Specifically, ignition regime maps are presented as a function of continuous firebrand generation rate, wind tunnel speed, and cedar moisture content.

 abstract = {Large outdoor fires are an increasing danger to the built environment. Wildfires that spread into communities, labeled as Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fires, are an example of large outdoor fires. Other examples of large outdoor fires are urban fires including those that may occur after earthquakes as well as in informal settlements. When vegetation and structures burn in large outdoor fires, pieces of burning material, known as firebrands, are generated, become lofted, and may be carried by the wind. This results in showers of wind-driven firebrands that may land ahead of the fire front, igniting vegetation and structures, and spreading the fire very fast. Post-fire disaster studies indicate that firebrand showers are a significant factor in the fire spread of multiple large outdoor fires. The present paper provides a comprehensive literature summary on the role of firebrand mechanisms on large outdoor fire spread. Experiments, models, and simulations related to firebrand generation, lofting, burning, transport, deposition, and ignition of materials are reviewed. Japan, a country that has been greatly influenced by ignition induced by firebrands that have resulted in severe large outdoor fires, is also highlighted here as most of this knowledge remains not available in the English language literature. The paper closes with a summary of the key research needs on this globally important problem.},

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines large outdoor fires as an urban fire, tsunami-generated fire, volcano-generated fire, wildland-urban interface (WUI) fire, wildland fire, or informal settlement fire, where the total burnout area is significant. Perhaps of all the large outdoor fires, it is wildland fires that spread into urban areas, simply called WUI fires that attract the most attention. A glance at the recent headlines in the summer of 2022 reveals numerous catastrophic WUI fires all over Europe. Across the Atlantic Ocean in the USA, there is yet another destructive WUI fire raging in the USA state of California. With the increasing risks from a changing climate, these large outdoor fire disasters are only going to become more and more commonplace all over the world. More homes will be lost and more lives will be lost. It is the authors opinion that a targeted, multi-disciplinary approach is needed to address the large outdoor fire problem. In this short, invited paper to               Horizons in Mechanical Engineering               , it is argued that large outdoor fire problem is a fascinating and challenging research area and that engineers have the necessary skills and training to impact a problem that influences millions upon millions of people all over the world. An important danger, present in all large outdoor fires, are firebrands. Firebrands are introduced for non-specialist readers, and the most recent literature is reviewed.

 abstract = {Over the past decades there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of disasters. The unpredictability of the circumstances around disasters means that proposed evacuation and transportation plans should be adaptable to the changing situation. Though the act of evacuating and the decision leading to it have been studied extensively, social aspects of the situation as well as other intermediate stops received less attention. This paper presents an investigation of data collected after a WUI fire that took place in Haifa, Israel, on November 24th, 2016. The results show individuals make multiple intermediate stops, before either evacuating or returning back home. A key goal within these stops is to visit home, which is a task undertaken the majority of households. A related phenomenon is that of waiting. The data shows that in many cases individuals report waiting at intermediate stops to learn more about the state of the event before taking further actions. With respect to their interactions, the results show that households tend to gather together during the event. This observation quantifies similar claims made in previous researches. These intra-household interactions are a main purpose of travel during such events. Within those, child pick-up stands out as a prominent activity. Child pick-up patterns suggest the involvement of a complex decision-making process which includes a wider social circle beyond household members. Thus, it is argued that the prediction of traffic during disasters would have to be based upon a full understanding of individuals' social along with intra-household spheres.},

 abstract = {The probability of structural ignition is dependent both on physical properties of materials and the fire exposure conditions. In this study, the effect of firebrand characteristics (i.e., firebrand size, number of firebrands) on wood ignition behavior was considered. Mathematical modeling and laboratory experiment were conducted to better understand the conditions of wood ignition by a single or group of firebrands with different geometry. This model considers the heat exchange between the firebrands, wood layer and the gas phase, moisture evaporation in the firebrands and the diffusion gases of water vapor in the pyrolysis zone. In order to test and verify the model, a series of experiments to determine probability and conditions for ignition of wood-based materials (plywood, oriented strand board, chipboard) caused by wildland firebrands (pine twigs with a diameter of 6--8 mm and a length of 40 {\textpm} 2 mm) were conducted. The experiments investigated the firebrand impact on the wood layer under different parameters, such as firebrand size and quantity, wind speed, and type of wood. The results of experiments showed that the increase in wind speed leads to the increase in probability of wood ignition. Based on the received results, it can be concluded that the ignition curve of wood samples by firebrands is nonlinear and depends on the wind speed and firebrand size as well as their quantity. At the same time, there is no ignition of wood samples in the range of wind speed of 0--1 m/s. The ignition of wood is possible with a decrease in the distance between the firebrands with a decrease in the firebrand length. This result agrees more closely with the model.},

Flaming firebrands were produced by heating and igniting wood chips of different shapes (square, longitudinal and rectangular) with a cone calorimeter. The firebrands generated preserved their shape during their heating. Their projected area was between 0.07 and 12.00~cm2 and their mass ranged from 0.57~mg to 2.66~g. The location of flaming firebrands, the minimal mass and the minimal number of firebrands needed to ignite the slabs were analysed in order to determine the critical conditions of ignition. The ignition of the decking slab only occurred when the firebrands were positioned at the interstices of the wooden slabs and against the leg of the thermoplastic slabs. No ignition occurred when the firebrands were located on the surface of the decking slab. A minimum mass of firebrands of 0.31~g and 0.80~g was necessary to ignite the wooden slabs and the thermoplastic ones, respectively. Less firebrands were needed to ignite wooden slabs than thermoplastic ones.},

Spot fires that occur far from the original burn unit are rare but have consequential ramifications since their prediction and control remains challenging. To facilitate their prediction, we examine three methods for quantifying the landing distribution of firebrands: crude Monte Carlo simulations, importance sampling, and large deviation theory (LDT). In particular, we propose an LDT method that accurately and parsimoniously quantifies the low probability events at the tail of the landing distribution. In contrast, Monte Carlo and importance sampling methods are most efficient in quantifying the high probability landing distances near the mode of the distribution. However, they become computationally intractable for quantifying the tail of the distribution due to the large sample size required. We also show that the most probable landing distance grows linearly with the mean characteristic velocity of the wind field. Furthermore, defining the relative landed mass as the proportion of mass landed at a given distance from the main fire, we derive an explicit formula which allows computing this quantity as a function of the landing distribution at a negligible computational cost. We numerically demonstrate our findings on two prescribed wind fields.},

The ignition threat of firebrand exposures can be characterized by measuring the heat transfer of glowing firebrands to a surface. The current study presents a novel method for conducting time-resolved heat transfer measurements from individual firebrands across a range of flow conditions. Experiments are conducted with individual glowing firebrands generated from birch discs and placed on a copper thin skin calorimeter of the same diameter, which is embedded in the substrate. The net heat flux from the firebrand to the thin skin calorimeter is obtained from the thermal energy storage in the thin skin calorimeter, plus heat conduction losses to the substrate. Values of peak net heat flux, total heating, duration of heating are reported under different flow conditions from 0.05 m/s to 1.6 m/s. The average peak net heat flux for the disc-shaped birch firebrands is 45 kW/m2, and does not change significantly with flow condition. However, there is an increase in the total heating, duration of heating, and total mass consumed as the flow velocity increases.},

Specifically, the experiments investigate the role of upstream buildings on the accumulation of embers on the rooftops of a building. Experiments were run for three target buildings for three different wind directions per building. The upstream array of buildings varied in both layout (staggered and regular grids of buildings) and in terms of the number of upstream rows of buildings and streamwise spacing between the buildings. Results indicate that each of these parameters, i.e. spacing, layout, and number of rows, influences the accumulation rate. In all cases tested the mass of embers that accumulated on the rooftops was less than 18\% of the mass that would have accumulated were the building removed. For buildings with roof heights similar to those of the upstream buildings the accumulation rate increases by up to a factor of 10 compared to when there are no upstream buildings. The lowest spacing between buildings produced the largest accumulation. When the target building roof height was larger than upstream buildings, this change was less pronounced. However, the variability in the accumulation rate between nominally identical tests decreased when the upstream buildings were present.},

Firebrands can not only cross fuel breaks and thwart other suppression efforts but also directly damage infrastructure and block evacuation routes. Transport models and computational fluid dynamics tools often make simplifications when predicting spot fire risk, but there is a relative lack of experimental data to validate such parameterizations. To this end, we present a field experiment performed at the University of California Berkeley Blodgett Research Forest in California where we recorded the flame and firebrands emanating from a nighttime hand-drawn pile fire using high-frequency imaging. We used image-processing to characterize the fire intensity and turbulence as well as particle tracking velocimetry to measure ejected firebrand kinematics as they are lofted by the plume. We further collected embers that settled around the fire at varying distances and measured their size, shape, density, and settling distributions. We also examine existing physics-based time-averaged models of firebrand lofting and note discrepancies between such models, often used due to their speed and simplicity, and our experimental observations. Finally, we discuss some implications our observations could have on future modeling efforts by considering the time-dependent fire dynamics, intermittency in the plume turbulence, and in the firebrand generation rate. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first in situ observations of firebrand generation and lofting from representative fuels, addressing a major source of data gap and uncertainty in the wildland fire literature.},

We make use of four recent large-scale fires in Sweden to elucidate which factors are important for survival, using multiple logistic regression analysis of data collected at the sites. We obtained data on 187 buildings within the fire perimeters, nearly all with wood paneling and tile- or sheet metal roofing. 35~\% of the buildings were lost or badly damaged. Results indicate that most buildings were approached by relatively low-intensity fire and that ignition primarily occurred through direct flame contact. The most important factor for survivability was the presence of a maintained lawn. The second most important was that no flammable material was present close to the building fa{\c c}ade. Further, fire intensity often decreased close to buildings due to a larger portion of deciduous trees around gardens than in the surrounding forest. These factors were more important than specific features of the building itself, reflecting that the majority of buildings have combustible wooden fa{\c c}ades. Our results suggest that the greatest potential for increasing building safety in the Swedish WUI is to keep the area immediately surrounding the building ({$\sim$}5 m) free from tree litter and other flammable material. Also, since fire intensities are generally low, buildings can in most cases be defended with simple tools without compromising personal safety.},

Wood pellets, bark, and twigs of pine were used to generate firebrands. An infrared camera (JADE J530SB) was used to obtain the necessary thermal video files. The thermograms were then processed to create an annotated IR video database that was used to test both the detector and the tracker. Following these studies, the analysis showed that the Difference of Gaussians detection algorithm and the Hungarian tracking algorithm upheld the highest level of accuracy and were the easiest to implement. The study also indicated that further development of detection and tracking algorithms using the current approach will not significantly improve their accuracy. As such, convolutional neural networks hold high potential to be used as an alternative approach.},

A cylindrical heater was used to model the firebrand, which allowed to control the incident radiative heat flux on the specimen, from the critical heat flux up to 25~kW/m2, for five different porosities of the fuel layer. Experimental ignition delay times were interpreted based on a theoretical model of the radiative heating of the fuel layer. Radiative heat transfer within the fuel layer was modeled by using the P1 approximation. In the limit of small ignition delay times an analytical expression was derived to correlate the inverse of the ignition time to the incident heat flux. This analytical expression is used to obtain the ignition temperature and effective properties for the forest fuel layers, namely the product of the fuel volume fraction by solid fuel density and solid heat capacity. Analytical solutions were found to be consistent with experimental data and a correlation relating the inverse of the non-dimensional time-to-ignition to the non-dimensional heat flux is provided.},

Three different sizes of disc wood particles (weighing about 1~g) are heated to generate smouldering firebrands, and then blown out by a horizontal wind of 5 or 7~m/s. In each experiment the transport distance (in the order of 1~m) and mass loss of firebrands are measured to examine their burning behaviours. For the first time, a bimodal distribution (burning and extinction modals) is observed for small firebrands under certain wind speeds (firebrands of 12-mm diameter and 5-mm thickness under a wind speed of 7~m/s in this work). Both the firebrand transport distance and mass loss in the extinction modal are smaller than those in the burning modal. The heat transfer analysis shows that there is a critical wind speed to quench the firebrand and produce a bimodal distribution, and its value increases with both the particle size and the heating duration. The predicted critical wind speed agrees well with experimental measurements.},

However, there is little published empirical evidence of the phenomenon. In this study, we have analysed spotting patterns observed from 251 wildfires from a database of over 8000 aerial line scan images capturing active wildfire across mainland southeast Australia between 2002 and 2018. The images were used to measure spot fire numbers, number of ``long-distance'' spot fires ({$>$} 500 m), and maximum spotting distance. We describe three types of spotting distance distributions, compare patterns among different regions of southeast Australia, and associate these with broad measures of rainfall, elevation, and fuel type. We found a relatively high correlation between spotting distance and numbers; however, there were also several cases of wildfires with low spot fire numbers producing very long-distance spot fires. Most long-distance spotting was associated with a ``multi-modal'' distribution type, where high numbers of spot fires ignite close to the source fire and isolated or small clumps of spot fires ignite at longer distances. The multi-modal distribution suggests that current models of spotting distance, which typically follow an exponential-shaped distribution, could underestimate long-distance spotting. We also found considerable regional variation in spotting phenomena that may be associated with significant variation in rainfall, topographic ruggedness, and fuel descriptors. East Victoria was the most spot-fire-prone of the regions, particularly in terms of long-distance spotting.},

The laws of variation of the aerodynamic drag and weight of firebrands as functions, of both time and relative wind speed are obtained experimentally in a wind tunnel. From these data the flight paths and corresponding lifetimes of the firebrands are calculated for giving horizontal wind conditions and for a certain model of the convection column above a fire. The conclusion was drawn that it is an excellent approximation to assume that the firebrands always fly at their final or terminal velocity of fall. This assumption considerably reduces the experimental work as well as the theoretical studies. The results obtained permit the valuation of the dangerous areas of possible fire propagation. Comparative results of the potential danger of firebrands according to size, shape, kind of wood, moisture content, and wind conditions are shown.

With increases in computational power, it is now possible to directly simulate the atmospheric conditions resulting from wildfires and such simulations can resolve the larger of the turbulent processes involved. Because of the time-scales at which these processes occur, the terminal-velocity assumption may not be justified when modelling ember transport using these simulations. In this study we use a large eddy simulation of a turbulent plume to examine the validity of the terminal-velocity assumption when modelling the long-range transport of non-combusting embers. The results indicate that the use of the terminal-velocity assumption significantly overestimates the density of ember landings at long range, particularly for embers with higher terminal fall speeds.},

 abstract = {Firebrand travel and ignition of spot fires is a major concern in the Wildland-Urban Interface and in wildfire operations overall. Firebrands allow for the efficient breaching across fuel-free barriers such as roads, rivers and constructed fuel breaks. Existing observation-based knowledge on medium-distance firebrand travel is often based on single tree experiments that do not replicate the intensity and convective updraft of a continuous crown fire. Recent advances in acoustic analysis, specifically pattern detection, has enabled the quantification of the rate at which firebrands are observed in the audio recordings of in-fire cameras housed within fire-proof steel boxes that have been deployed on experimental fires. The audio pattern being detected is the sound created by a flying firebrand hitting the steel box of the camera. This technique allows for the number of firebrands per second to be quantified and can be related to the fire's location at that same time interval (using a detailed rate of spread reconstruction) in order to determine the firebrand travel distance. A proof of concept is given for an experimental crown fire that shows the viability of this technique. When related to the fire's location, key areas of medium-distance spotting are observed that correspond to regions of peak fire intensity. Trends on the number of firebrands landing per square metre as the fire approaches are readily quantified using low-cost instrumentation.},

 abstract = {To date, due to difficulties in making measurements during wildfires, much of what is known about firebrand showers and the subsequent fire spotting comes from mathematical modeling of the lofting and downwind transport of firebrands. However, these models lack experimental validation. Hence, the coupled lofting and downwind transport of non-combusting rod-like firebrands is experimentally modeled by releasing them through the velocity field of a large scale boundary layer wind tunnel. Complete trajectories of model firebrands are resolved using image processing algorithms. The results show a strong positive correlation between the maximum rise height (zmax) and the landing location (xl) of model firebrands. In addition, it is shown that, given the velocity field, the empirical probability density functions (PDF) of xl/zmax are similar regardless of the firebrands' aspect ratio. This implies that the lofting and downwind transport processes cannot be decoupled in transport models. Analysis of the data reveals that, the larger the aspect ratio of firebrands, the more sensitive their landing locations are to the variability in the velocity field through which they are released. The data set presented herein serves as the most comprehensive experimental evidence for not only firebrand transport studies but also for validating mathematical models for the flight of rod-like debris/brands within the velocity field of other extreme events such as hurricanes.},

Variants of Tachikawa's transport models have been developed for different shapes of debris but, only simplified versions are implemented in firebrand transport models. Failure to include lift and rotational forces reduces the problem to a two-dimensional one, in contrast to the 3D trajectories observed. As such, many studies may have under-/overestimated the flight distance and failed to capture the spotting distribution, accurately. Also, there is virtually no detailed quantitative experimental validation available for rod-like debris transport models. Hence, a set of free-fall experiments with non-combusting model firebrands were run in the absence of cross-wind. The results are employed for verification and performance evaluation of a 3D deterministic 6-Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) rod-like debris transport model. It is shown that a transport model must include the complete 6-DOF aerodynamics of the debris for estimating the flight characteristics, such that results are not statistically significantly different from the experimental data. The findings have applications beyond firebrand transport, as they represent the most comprehensive experimental data set and analysis of rod-like debris transport, currently in the literature.},

Firebrands are a harbinger of damage to infrastructure; their effects particularly pose a threat to people living within the wildland-urban-interface, they can hamper the suppression of wildfire and block evacuation routes for communities and emergency services. Short-range firebrands which travel along with the wind, with little or no lofting, are particularly crucial in increasing fire front propagation and damaging structures situated close to the wildland-urban interface. In the Daylesford fire of 1962 in Australia, massive short-range spotting (the process of spot fire ignition and merging of spots caused by firebrands) occurred in the eucalyptus forest and increased the rate of fire spread by roughly three times more than that computed using an operational fire model. Similarly, long-range firebrands can be transported by the fire plume and ambient wind and can ignite new fire up to 30--40~km from the source of fire as observed in the 2009 Black Saturday fire in Australia. A large amount of experimental research has been conducted to quantify the effects of firebrands, to develop empirical models and to benchmark results for Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) based fire model validations. In recent years, some CFD models have been studied primarily for their validation purposes. These studies have been reviewed here. To perform useful parametric studies of firebrand transport using CFD models as well as further development of CFD models, more targeted studies need to be conducted.},

The firebrand projected area is correlated with firebrand diameter, char density, wind speed, and flaming or smouldering burning. A surface temperature model is derived in terms of condensed-phase energy conservation. We finally establish a simplified firebrand transport model based on the burning rate, projected area and surface temperature of firebrands.Conclusion The mass loss due to wood pyrolysis is much greater than that due to char oxidation in self-sustaining burning. The burning rate is proportional to U1/2, where U is wind speed. The projected area for flaming firebrands decreases more rapidly than that for smouldering ones. The firebrand surface temperature is mainly determined by radiation.Implications Knowledge about firebrand burning characteristics is essential for predicting the flight distance and trajectory in firebrand transport.},

 abstract = {A new instrument to quantify firebrand dynamics during fires with particular focus on those associated with the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) has been developed. During WUI fires, firebrands can ignite spot fires, which can rapidly increase the rate of spread (ROS) of the fire, provide a mechanism by which the fire can pass over firebreaks and are the leading cause of structure ignitions. Despite this key role in driving wildfire dynamics and hazards, difficulties in collecting firebrands in the field and preserving their physical condition (e.g. dimensions and temperature) have limited the development of knowledge of firebrand dynamics. In this work we present a new, field-deployable diagnostic tool, an emberometer, designed to provide measurement of firebrand fluxes and information on both the geometry and the thermal conditions of firebrands immediately before deposition by combining a visual and infrared camera. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to calibrate and validate the developed imaging techniques. The emberometer was then deployed in the field to explore firebrand fluxes and particle conditions for a range of fire intensities in natural pine forest environments. In addition to firebrand particle characterization, field observations with the emberometer enabled detailed time history of deposition (i.e. firebrand flux) relative to concurrent in situ fire behaviour observations. We highlight that deposition was characterised by intense, short duration ``showers'' that can be reasonably associated to spikes in the average fire line intensity. The results presented illustrate the potential use of an emberometer in studying firebrand and spot fire dynamics.},

The surface temperature of glowing combustion on the firebrands was measured with color ratio pyrometry. The ignition outcome results show a similar hyperbolic relationship between air flow and coverage density for both firebrand sizes although accumulations of small firebrands can cause the ignition faster. A firebrand combustion model was adopted to predict the surface temperature of accumulated firebrands considering re-radiation between nearby firebrands. A correlation between the ignition time and characteristics of accumulations was also established based on a theoretical combustion and heat transfer analysis.},
