	abstract = {We present a novel method for the combustion of botanical tree models. Tree models are represented as connected particles for the branching structure and a polygonal surface mesh for the combustion. Each particle stores biological and physical attributes that drive the kinetic behavior of a plant and the exothermic reaction of the combustion. Coupled with realistic physics for rods, the particles enable dynamic branch motions. We model material properties, such as moisture and charring behavior, and associate them with individual particles. The combustion is efficiently processed in the surface domain of the tree model on a polygonal mesh. A user can dynamically interact with the model by initiating fires and by inducing stress on branches. The flames realistically propagate through the tree model by consuming the available resources. Our method runs at interactive rates and supports multiple tree instances in parallel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerous examples and evaluate its plausibility against the combustion of real wood samples.},

	abstract = {Australia is considered as the most fire-prone country in the world. Spotting ignition by lofted firebrands is the main mechanism of fire spread. Many experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of the firebrand attacks on structures and to identify possible solutions. The experimental facility consists of a firebrand generator coupled to a wind tunnel. The wind speed in the firebrand generator is relatively low, in order to assure a quality continuous flow of glowing firebrands. On the contrary, the wind speed in the wind tunnel is high to duplicate actual firebrand attacks. Previous works show a highly turbulent region above the entrance of firebrands to the wind tunnel which is formed because of the velocity difference and penetration of firebrand entrance hose into the wind tunnel. The penetration is required to provide a uniform firebrand distribution along the height of the test section. In this computational work, the influence of the height of the entrance hose, its orientation respect to the tunnel and the distance between the coupling port and the test section are analyzed. The optimized results are presented and discussed for a variety of wind speeds within the wind tunnel and the firebrand generator.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a numerical investigation of the impact of a wind-driven surface ﬁre, comparable to a large wildﬁre, on an obstacle located downstream of the ﬁre source. The numerical modelling was conducted using {FireFOAM}, a coupled ﬁre-atmosphere model underpinned by a large eddy simulation ({LES}) solver, which is based on the Eddy Dissipation Concept ({EDC}) combustion model and implemented in the {OpenFOAM} platform (an open source {CFD} tool). The numerical data were validated using the aerodynamic measurements of a full-scale building model in the absence of ﬁre effects. The results highlighted the physical phenomena contributing to the ﬁre spread pattern and its thermal impact on the building. In addition, frequency analysis of the surface temperature ﬂuctuations ahead of the ﬁre front showed that the presence of a building inﬂuences the growth and formation of buoyant instabilities, which directly affect the behaviour of the ﬁre’s plume. The coupled ﬁre-atmosphere modelling presented here constitutes a fundamental step towards better understanding the behaviour and potential impacts of large wind-driven wildland ﬁres in wildland-urban interface ({WUI}) areas.},

	abstract = {Burning embers, commonly called ﬁrebrands, are lofted by a ﬁre’s buoyant plume and transported downwind to ignite new ﬁres (spot ﬁres) ahead of the main ﬁre. In the present work, transport and combustion of ﬁrebrands from burning trees are numerically investigated. A three-dimensional physics-based model is used to precompute the steady-state gas ﬂow and thermal ﬁelds induced by a crown ﬁre into which ﬁrebrands will be injected. Another preliminary study of the thermal degradation and combustion of woody fuel particles is conducted to determine the burning characteristics of ﬁrebrands. Then the trajectories and burning rates of disk-shaped ﬁrebrands lofted by the crown ﬁre plume and transported downwind are calculated for various values of the wind speed, Uwind, and of the ﬁre intensity, I . Firebrands of different sizes and densities are ﬁrst launched from a speciﬁed location at the top of the canopy. Firebrands that fall on the ground are in a ﬂaming or a glowing state depending on the product ρfw0 × τ (ρfw0 : initial ﬁrebrand density, τ : ﬁrebrand thickness). Results show that for ﬁrebrands that remain longer in the thermal plume, the distance covered upon landing is independent of the initial particle diameter and correlates well with I 0.1Uw0.i9nd(ρfw0 × τ )−0.2. The normalized brand mass fraction at landing also correlates with the ﬂight time normalized by the product ρfw0 × τ for ﬂaming ﬁrebrands or by the product ρfw0 × D05/3 (D0: initial ﬁrebrand diameter) for glowing ﬁrebrands. For ﬁrebrands released from random locations within the canopy, the above correlations remain unchanged, thereby demonstrating the generality of the developed approach.},

Typically, the assumption made is that the balance between aerodynamic forces and weight deﬁnes the characteristic size of lofted brands. This work develops a model for predicting the size distribution of brands lofted from a fractal tree using simple mechanical breakage models that are coupled to a simple thermal decomposition model. The breakage model is parameterized by fuel density and strength data that are experimentally generated. Dimensionless parameters are identiﬁed to characterize the degradation and breakage processes. The breakage model is then coupled to a plume model to form a description of the breakage, transport, and mass loss of branching vegetative fuel packets in wildland ﬁre scenarios. A Monte Carlo simulation is then performed for branching fuels in a wildland ﬁre case study, and the presence of an optimal branch diameter for mass transport by brand lofting is identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {Laminar burning velocities of hydrogen/air mixtures can show discrepancies up to 30\%, making chemical mechanism validation and improvement diﬃcult. The source of uncertainties may come from diﬀerent factors inﬂuencing at each processing and post-processing steps the ﬁnal value. Considering a spherically expanding ﬂame conﬁguration, reﬂection on the accuracy of the formulations, used to derive the desired quantity, is proposed. Starting from the exact deﬁnition of the laminar burning velocity, two formulations – direct and indirect ﬂame speeds formulations – are derived for spherical ﬂames. Each single source of uncertainty involved in the formulations is pointed out. The emphasis is focused on a speciﬁc mixture at an equivalence ratio of 0.50, atmospheric pressure, and an initial temperature of 300 K. This point represents the best tradeoﬀ between low ratio of ﬂame velocity and recording sampling rate and the occurrence of cellular ﬂames (Le {\textless} 1). An extensive experimental and numerical study (1D spherically expanding ﬂames) of this mixture is carried out. As a result, the experimental laminar burning velocities determined by using the direct ﬂame speed or the indirect ﬂame speed formulae depict diﬀerent values. However, when numerically determined, both formulae yield the same value. This paves the way to understand and identify the experimental error sources. Stretch and Lewis numbers eﬀects (super-adiabatic temperatures) as well as radiation processes (burned gas motion) are studied. Nonetheless, they do not show to be the main source of uncertainty. The extrapolation procedure (linear or non-linear) according to the limited number of experimental points (rapid apparition of cellular structure) appears as the main factor inﬂuencing the discrepancy in laminar burning velocities.},

Flame structure, local gas temperature as well as local soot volume fraction and primary soot particle diameter, are simultaneously detected by means of {OH} planar laser-induced fluorescence ({PLIF}), non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence ({nTLAF}) of indium, and time-resolved ({TiRe}) laser-induced incandescence ({LII}), respectively. The collected data sets were used to generate joint statistics of soot properties and flame characteristics and provided new insights into the interaction of the {OH} layer and soot in turbulent flames. The interaction of {OH} and soot as a driving mechanism for soot oxidation is of particular interest as it has been proven to be challenging to model. Statistics of soot volume fraction and primary particle size in the {OH} layer are employed to gain deeper insights into the soot oxidation process. Mean soot volume fraction and primary soot particle size conditioned on temperature and {OH} signal intensity indicate that, due to differential diffusion of soot with respect to the chemical species, high soot volume fraction and primary soot particle diameter of up to 50 nm are present at low temperatures and low {OH} concentration. In the soot oxidation region, statistical analysis of the soot parameters disclose that clusters of high soot volume fraction mostly consist of large primary particles. Observations from instantaneous images and the presence of large primary particles inside the {OH} layer suggest that the oxidation is not sufficiently fast to burn the soot completely.},

This work leverages the temperature-sensitive phosphorescence of {YAG}:Dy to non-intrusively measure and spatially resolve firebrand contact temperature along a 6.1 cm diameter area. The highly coupled firebrand heat transfer problem is studied by depositing smoldering firebrands onto a flat inert substrate and subjecting them to flow speeds of (1.5 ± 0.15) m/s. The temporal evolution of the thermal footprint is described and analyzed. Quasi-steady peak contact temperatures ranged between 500 K and 850 K while brief peaks exceeding 1150 K were also observed. The large difference in contact temperatures alludes to the significance in factors such as firebrand-fuel contact resistance, firebrand geometry, firebrand-flow orientation, fuel type (density and heat of combustion), and mass. Furthermore, the findings shed light on secondary heating events associated with shifting of the firebrand contact area and/or fragmenting, which can impart peak net heat flux equivalent to 70 \% of the initial deposition. Lastly, considering the sensitivity of ignition on temperature, the work provides a brief discussion on the presence of unimodal and bimodal contact temperature distributions.},

Both types are present in most wildfires, and despite being fundamentally different in chemical and physical terms, one transitions to the other. Traditionally, science has focused on flames, while smouldering is often misinterpreted. But smouldering wildfires are emerging as a global concern because they cause extensive air pollution, emit very large amounts of carbon, are difficult to detect and suppress, and could accelerate climate change. Central to the topic are smouldering peat fires that lead to the largest fires on Earth. Smouldering also dominates the residual burning after flames have died out and firebrand ignition. Finally, smouldering is an important part of Arctic wildfires, which are increasing in frequency. Here, we present a scientific overview of smouldering wildfires, the associated environmental and health issues, including climate change, and the challenges in prevention and mitigation.},

	abstract = {Experimental study on combustion and fire safety of energy conservation materials (extruded polystyrene, i.e., {XPS}) in vertical channel with front openings of building façade is conducted, and effects of channel structure factor (α) and curtain wall coverage rate (β) are revealed. The {XPS} flame in the vertical channel is turbulent. There is a correlation between the flame height and pyrolysis length: xf = mxnp, where m and n vary with the change in structure factor and coverage rate. Upward flame spread rate decreases first and then increases as β rises. When 0 ≤ β {\textless} 0.2, the restraining effect of vertical channel on air entrainment dominates, while for 0.2 ≤ β ≤ 0.8, the heat feedback from curtain wall dominates. When β = 0, the influence of α on flame spread rate is not significant. The flame spread rate increases with increasing α when 0.2 ≤ β ≤ 0.8. A model is established to predict the flame spread rate under different coverage rates and structure factors. Compared with experimental results, the prediction error is smaller than 10\%. Larger values of flame height and flame spread rate correspond to higher fire hazard. This work is beneficial for fire safety assessment of building thermal insulation materials and optimal design of energysaving curtain wall.},

In order to achieve high-ﬁdelity regression models with reduced model errors and bias, this study constructs extensive experimental databases for reinforced and unreinforced concrete joints by collecting existing beam-column joint subassemblage tests from multiple sources. Various inﬂuential parameters that affect joint shear strength such as material properties, design parameters, and joint conﬁguration are investigated through tests of statistical signiﬁcance. After performing a set of regression analyses, the comparison of simulation results indicates that {MARS} approach is the best estimation method. Moreover, the accuracy of analytical predictions of the derived {MARS} model is compared with that of existing joint shear strength relationships. The comparison results show that the proposed model is more accurate compared to existing relationships. This joint shear strength prediction model can be readily implemented into joint response models for evaluation of earthquake performance and inelastic responses of building frames.

	abstract = {Forest wild fire prevention that is carried out to minimize of wild fires number and possible damage from them, is inconceivable without the development of fire-prevention procedures, which are based on data from wild fire monitoring. One of the areas of wild fires monitoring is the evaluation of forest wild fires spreading ability to transportation of firebrands by the wind. This way observed at crown-type of forest wild fires, which are formed from ground ones by transferring the flame to the trees crowns when the wind reaches a certain speed. A mathematical model has been developed for the firebrands transportation by the wind. Mathematical model adequacy was evaluated by inclusion of transfer coefficient as a ratio of firebrand speed to wind speed. The modeling of the horizontal firebrands transportation (sphere, cylinder and disc) has been carried out. Experimental conditions are firebrands have various sizes, fall off from a height of 5-20 m, at a wind speed of 1-5 m∙s-1. Spherical and discshaped particles have the best transportation ability. The adequacy of the model of horizontal firebrands transportation has been experimentally proved by conducting our own experiments and analyzing information obtained from the literature on similar studies. The results of the experiments showed that with an increase in the air flow speed up to 10 m∙s-1, the speed of the burning particle does not exceed the speed of the air flow that stimulates it. Thus, it is shown that within the air flow velocity of 1-10 m∙s-1, the value of the transfer coefficient does not exceed one.},

	abstract = {The recent bushﬁres (2019–2020) in New South Wales ({NSW}) Australia were catastrophic by claiming human and animal lives, affecting ecosystems, destroying infrastructure, and more. Recent studies have investigated relationships between hydroclimatic signals and past bushﬁres, and very recently, a few commentary papers claimed drought and fuel moisture content as the probable causes for the widespread 2019–2020 bushﬁres. Therefore, in this study, a novel work of encompassing a wide range of factors attributing to the recent bushﬁres is presented. Empirical evidence‐based statistical methods are used to identify the hydroclimatic variables and geomorphic characteristics contributing to the 2019–2020 bushﬁres. The results highlight that ongoing drought, surface soil moisture ({SSM}), wind speed ({WS}10), relative humidity ({RH}), heat waves ({HW}), dead and live fuel moisture, and certain land cover types create favorable conditions for ﬁre ignition and aid in ﬁre propagation in different regions of the {NSW} state. The ﬁndings suggest that accounting for the above‐identiﬁed variables in bushﬁre prediction and monitoring system are crucial in avoiding such catastrophes in the future. The overarching application of this study is developing robust and more versatile ﬁre protection planning and management. Plain Language Summary Since the 2019–2020 Australian bushﬁres were catastrophic in terms of burnt area and severity, a detailed analysis of the primary causes is crucial. In this paper, several probable causes are tested statistically to establish their relationship with the burnt area. The results indicate that the ongoing drought, surface soil moisture, wind speed, relative humidity, heat waves, dead and live fuel moisture, and land cover with certain vegetation (particularly native eucalyptus and grazing land) are the primary causes of the widespread bushﬁre. These results are extremely critical in updating the current bushﬁre planning and management.},

	abstract = {Several studies suggest that the ﬁrebrands are a major cause of structural ignition of Wildland–Urban Interface ﬁres in {USA} and Australia. For 40 years, past ﬁrebrand studies have focused on how far ﬁrebrands ﬂy and do not assess the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from ﬁrebrand showers. The development of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) Dragon has allowed the quantiﬁcation of structure ignition vulnerabilities of full-scale building assemblies. Full-scale tests are necessary to highlight vulnerabilities of structures to ignition under ﬁrebrand attack, whereas bench-scale test methods afford the capability to test new ﬁrebrand-resistant technologies and may serve as the basis for new standard testing methodologies. To this end, the present investigation was undertaken to construct a new and improved Dragon’s Lofting and Ignition Research facility. This entailed removing the {NIST} Baby Dragon from the wind tunnel facility and inserting the new and improved {NIST} continuous feed Baby Dragon. The unique feature of the continuous feed Baby Dragon, over the current {NIST} Baby Dragon, is the capability to produce a constant ﬁrebrand shower in order to expose building materials to continual ﬁrebrand bombardment. The efﬁcacy of the new experimental facility to determine ignition regime maps of building materials exposed to wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers is presented. Speciﬁcally, ignition regime maps are presented as a function of continuous ﬁrebrand generation rate, wind tunnel speed, and cedar moisture content. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These experiments were performed over a range of wind tunnel speeds, with no wind speed present to 9 m/s, to determine the lofting distance of the ﬁrebrands generated.

	abstract = {Attempting to experimentally quantify the vulnerabilities of structures to ignition from ﬁrebrand showers has remained elusive. The coupling of two facilities has begun to unravel this difﬁcult problem. The {NIST} Firebrand Generator ({NIST} Dragon) is an experimental device that can generate a ﬁrebrand shower in a safe and repeatable fashion. Since wind plays a critical role in the spread of {WUI} ﬁres in the {USA} and urban ﬁres in Japan, {NIST} has established collaboration with the Building Research Institute ({BRI}) in Japan. {BRI} maintains one of the only full scale wind tunnel facilities in the world designed speciﬁcally for ﬁre experimentation; the Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility ({FRWTF}). The present investigation is aimed at extensively quantifying ﬁrebrand penetration through building vents using full scale tests. A structure was placed inside the {FRWTF} and ﬁrebrand showers were directed at the structure using the {NIST} Dragon. The structure was ﬁtted with a generic building vent, consisting of only a frame ﬁtted with a metal mesh. Six different mesh sizes openings were used for testing. Behind the mesh, four different materials were placed to ascertain whether the ﬁrebrands that were able to penetrate the building mesh assembly could ignite these materials. Reduced scale test methods afford the capability to test new vent technologies and may serve as the basis for new standard testing methodologies. As a result, a new experimental facility developed at {NIST} is presented and is known as the {NIST} Dragon’s {LAIR} (Lofting and Ignition Research). The {NIST} Dragon’s {LAIR} has been developed to simulate a wind driven ﬁrebrand attack at reduced scale. The facility consists of a reduced scale Firebrand Generator (Baby Dragon) coupled to a bench scale wind tunnel. Finally, a series of full scale experiments were conducted to visualize the ﬂow of ﬁrebrands around obstacles placed downstream of the {NIST} Dragon. Firebrands were observed to accumulate in front of these obstacles at a stagnation plane, as was observed when the structure was used for ﬁrebrand penetration through building vent experiments, due to ﬂow recirculation. The accumulation of ﬁrebrands at a stagnation plane presents a severe threat to ignitable materials placed near structures.},

	abstract = {Wildland-Urban Interface ({WUI}) ﬁres have become a problem of great concern across multiple continents. An important mechanism of structure ignition in {WUI} ﬁres and urban ﬁres is the production of ﬁrebrands. During {WUI} ﬁres, decking assemblies have been observed to be an ignition vulnerability based on post-ﬁre damage surveys conducted by {NIST} and elsewhere. The authors have conducted scoping experiments and demonstrated the dangers of the dynamic process of continual, winddriven ﬁrebrand showers landing on decking assemblies for wind speeds of 6 m/s. In this study, eight full-scale experiments were conducted with wood decking assemblies under a wind speed of 8 m/s. The basis for these new investigations was twofold: observe possible vulnerabilities of wood decking assemblies to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrands at higher wind speed as ﬁrebrand accumulation patterns were expected to be inﬂuenced by wind speed, and examine if wall ignition occurred due to the burning decking assembly. To this end, sections of wood decking assemblies (1.2 m by 1.2 m) were constructed and attached to a reentrant corner assembly. The deck/reentrant corner assembly was then exposed to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrand bombardment generated by a full-scale Continuous Feed Firebrand Generator installed in the Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility ({FRWTF}) at the Building Research Institute ({BRI}) in Japan. The mass of ﬁrebrands required for ﬂaming ignitions under a wind speed of 8 m/s was considerably less compared with those under a wind speed of 6 m/s. This result is postulated to be due to higher ﬁrebrand surface temperatures as the wind speed was increased. For the decking assembly to wall ignition studies, the interface between the decking assembly and the wall appeared to be a weak point; this is not addressed in the current test methods.},

Past work by the authors demonstrated for the ﬁrst-time that wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers may accumulate in these stagnation planes. While those experiments demonstrated this important phenomenon, due to the limited duration of ﬁrebrand showers of the original {NIST} Batch-Feed Firebrand Generator, it was not possible to perform a more systematic study. To this end, a series of detailed experiments were performed using the recently developed {NIST} Continuous-Feed Firebrand Generator capable of ﬁrebrand showers of unlimited duration. Full-scale walls of varying size were placed downstream of the device and the wind speed was varied in increments up to 10 m/s. The experiments were conducted in the Building Research Institute's Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility ({FRWTF}). For a given wall size exposed to speciﬁc ﬁrebrand size/mass distribution, it was observed that wind speed inﬂuences not only the spatial location and extent of the accumulated ﬁrebrands in the stagnation plane in front of the wall, but also the nature of the smoldering combustion intensity of the accumulated ﬁrebrands. The experiments demonstrated that higher wind speeds (10 m/s) did not promote accumulation of ﬁrebrands in stagnation planes in front of walls. The data may be used to provide guidance to appropriate separation distances that combustibles should be placed near structures and is also of great use to develop and validate numerical models of ﬁrebrand accumulation.},

To describe the transition of the half-width of the cross section, the temperature elevation, and the velocity of ﬁre plumes along the trajectory, a similarity model was derived by dimensional analysis. This model is equivalent to that in a quiescent environment, with the cross-wind eﬀect embodied in the distance along the trajectory. Therefore, the derived model reasonably correlated the half-width of the cross section with the temperature elevation. It also obtained the measured temperature elevation at ground level (0.02 m above the ﬂoor) downwind of the ﬁre sources. In this evaluation, the correlation between the measured and computed data points was improved by introducing a virtual source that considered both the ﬁre source size and the crosswind velocity eﬀects.},

An experimental series was undertaken to vary the board spacing from 0 mm (no gaps), 5 mm, and 10 mm, to determine if it was possible to observe reduced ignition propensity of full-scale wood decking assemblies fitted to a reentrant corner wall assembly. In these experiments, three common wood types were used and firebrand showers were directed at the wall/decking assemblies using wind speeds of 8 m/s generated using a realistic-scale wind tunnel. Based on the results of these experiments, it was observed that board spacing significantly influenced ignition propensity of these as­ semblies. Ignition events were observed for all board spacing considered and in particular, more ignition points were observed for a board spacing of 10 mm.},

However, the large probabilistic variability in its generation, transport, and ignition processes causes difficulty in quantifying its risk. In this study, a series of wind tunnel experiments was conducted to understand the proba­ bilistically varying characteristics of two among three processes involved in spot ignition, i.e., the generation and transport of firebrands. Analysis samples were generated by combusting a wood crib in an apparatus that sim­ ulates the behavior of a fully developed structural fire. The experimental parameters were the ejection height of firebrands, H, crosswind velocity, U∞, and thickness of wood stick used for assembling the wood crib, d. Utilizing the experimental results, the projected area of a firebrand and its transport distance downwind of a fire source were formulated based on simple physical considerations. However, because the obtained correlations represent deterministic relationships of the parameters, they were further incorporated into probability distributions (a truncated exponential distribution for the projected area and a truncated normal distribution for the transport distance) to enable the consideration of intrinsic variations. The obtained models reasonably reproduced the experimental results for both the projected area and transport distance. Although structural fire is the targeted type of fire source, the proposed models exhibit forms extensible to other types of fire sources.},

A cylindrical heater was used to model the firebrand, which allowed to control the incident radiative heat flux on the specimen, from the critical heat flux up to 25 {kW}/m2, for five different porosities of the fuel layer. Experimental ignition delay times were interpreted based on a theoretical model of the radiative heating of the fuel layer. Radiative heat transfer within the fuel layer was modeled by using the P1 approximation. In the limit of small ignition delay times an analytical expression was derived to correlate the inverse of the ignition time to the incident heat flux. This analytical expression is used to obtain the ignition temperature and effective properties for the forest fuel layers, namely the product of the fuel volume fraction by solid fuel density and solid heat capacity. Analytical solutions were found to be consistent with experimental data and a correlation relating the inverse of the non-dimensional time-toignition to the non-dimensional heat flux is provided.},

Ratio pyrometry is performed using a color digital camera calibrated with a blackbody furnace at 600–1200 ◦C. Over 1600 images of 55 stationary and streaking embers were recorded and analyzed. The same ember temperatures were obtained for stationary embers as for streaking embers with either a horizontal or a vertical axis of camera rotation. The mean ember temperatures were 918 ad 955 ◦C for 1 and 2 m/s wind velocities. These were independent of ember distance and velocity, but generally increased with time after ignition at a mean rate of 0.77 ◦C/s. The diagnostic has an estimated measurement uncertainty of ±20 ◦C and similar accuracy for stationary and streaking embers.},

This manuscript is the result of one of the {IRC}’s initiatives to review current knowledge on exposures associated with large outdoor fires, identify existing knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations for future research. The article consists of two sections: the wildland fire exposure to the built environment and the settlement fire exposure to structures. Each section presents a comprehensive review of experimental and numerical studies of exposure mechanisms (flame contact and convection, radiation, and firebrands).

	abstract = {Spotting ignition by firebrands is a significant fire spread pathway at the wildland-urban interface ({WUI}), where mulch products are commonly used as landscaping materials. Mulch is typically organic in nature, thus it may be easily ignited into a smoldering mode by firebrands and subsequently transition to flaming, leading to direct flame contact and radiant heat exposure to siding materials of adjacent structures. This work quantified the thresholds of smoldering ignition of four common types of commercially available mulch (black mulch ({BM}), forest floor ({FF}), redwood ({RW}), and fir bark ({FB})) exposed to heating by smoldering firebrand piles, and their propensity for smoldering-to-flaming transition under external winds (up to 1.4 m/s). We found that there was a minimum mass of firebrand pile to achieve smoldering ignition of mulch (e.g., {\textasciitilde}0.1 g for {FF}). Beyond this minimum mass, the required wind speed to trigger smoldering ignition generally decreased as the mass of the firebrand pile increased, agreeing well with theoretical analysis. After smoldering ignition, smoldering-toflaming transition could be observed when the wind speed exceeded a critical value (e.g., {\textasciitilde}1 m/s for {FF}), which was not affected by the initial spotting process. To achieve smoldering-to-flaming transition, the glowing mulch had to reach a critical temperature of around 850 ◦C. Mulch samples with larger particle sizes were more likely to smolder and transition to flaming, due to increased oxygen supply through larger inter-particle pores and channels and better firebrand accumulation due to a more crevice-like geometry on the fuel surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of the ignition and burning behavior of landscaping mulches, and thus contributes to the prevention of extreme {WUI} fire events.},

The unique features of the continuous feed Baby Dragon, as opposed to the present {NIST} Dragon, is the capability to produce a constant firebrand shower in order to expose building materials to continual firebrand bombardment. An experimental series was conducted to determine the range of operating conditions for this device. Wood pieces were fed into the device using a conveyer system, ignited using a propane burner, and a blower was used to loft the generated firebrands. The number flux and mass flux were measured as a function of feeding rate to determine optimum conditions to generate steady firebrand showers. It was observed that a feeding rate of 15 pieces (34.6 g/min) provided the most constant and uniform continuous firebrand production. Measurements of heat release rate ({HRR}) were conducted to make sure the device provided low {HRR} in order to determine if it may be considered for use by testing laboratories in a safe manner. Finally, the firebrand size and mass produced using the newly developed device presented in this paper are commensurate to those measured from full-scale tree burns and actual {WUI} fires.},

Two unique features in this tunnel design set it aside from previous vertical wind tunnels: the vertical working section has a divergent taper that allows a ﬁrebrand to ﬁnd its terminal velocity within a velocity gradient, and the velocity of the boundary layer of the working section has been forced to a higher speed than the central zone to stop the ﬁrebrand impacting on the working section walls. These features in combination with a responsive speed control on the fan allow observation of burning ﬁrebrands throughout their viable lifetime in freefall with changing terminal velocities. This paper is intended as a synthesis of wind tunnel design and as a guide to researchers considering building similar devices to study the untethered ﬂight characteristics of local species of ﬁrebrands.},

As a result, a series of experiments were conducted to examine ignition of wood fencing assemblies subjected to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers. Western Red Cedar and Redwood fencing assemblies were exposed to continuous, wind-driven ﬁrebrands generated by the {NIST} full-scale Continuous Feed Firebrand Generator installed in the Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility at the Building Research Institute in Japan. To simulate ﬁne fuels that may be present near fencing assemblies, dried shredded hardwood mulch beds were placed adjacent to the fencing assemblies. The fencing assemblies were varied in length and in orientation to the applied wind ﬁeld to simulate a range of conﬁgurations that may be encountered in realistic situations. Both ﬂat and corner sections of fencing assemblies were used in these experiments. The dimensions of the ﬂat wood fencing assemblies sections were varied from 0.91 m wide, 1.83 m in height to 1.83 m wide, 1.83 m in height. With respect to the corner sections, the dimensions used were 0.91 m by 0.91 m by 1.83 m in height. All conﬁgurations considered resulted in ﬂaming ignition ({FI}) of the mulch beds, and subsequent {FI} of the wood fencing assemblies. Finally, experiments were also completed to determine if wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers could produce {FI} of fencing assemblies without the presence of ﬁne fuels adjacent to the fence sections. Firebrands produced smoldering ignition ({SI}) of the fencing assemblies without ﬁne fuels present, and {SI} transitioned to {FI} under the applied wind ﬁeld. These experiments have demonstrated that wood fencing assemblies are vulnerable to ignition by wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers.},

In this study, we conduct experiments in a wind tunnel to investigate the eﬀect of wind on the smouldering burning and transport of ﬁrebrands. Three diﬀerent sizes of disc wood particles (weighing about 1 g) are heated to generate smouldering ﬁrebrands, and then blown out by a horizontal wind of 5 or 7 m/s. In each experiment the transport distance (in the order of 1 m) and mass loss of ﬁrebrands are measured to examine their burning behaviours. For the ﬁrst time, a bimodal distribution (burning and extinction modals) is observed for small ﬁrebrands under certain wind speeds (ﬁrebrands of 12-mm diameter and 5-mm thickness under a wind speed of 7 m/s in this work). Both the ﬁrebrand transport distance and mass loss in the extinction modal are smaller than those in the burning modal. The heat transfer analysis shows that there is a critical wind speed to quench the ﬁrebrand and produce a bimodal distribution, and its value increases with both the particle size and the heating duration. The predicted critical wind speed agrees well with experimental measurements.},

	abstract = {Fire poses a signiﬁcant risk to the safety, health, and property of people around the world. However, traditional ‘‘point sensor’’ ﬁre detection techniques for indoor buildings based on air particles, air temperatures, and smoke have a low sensitivity, long response time, and poor stability. Therefore, video-based ﬁre detection has become a particularly eﬃcient and important method for detecting the early signs of a ﬁre. Due to image blur, low illumination, ﬂame-like interference and other factors, there is a certain error rate of ﬁre recognition using video ﬂame recognition methods. According to our previous study of a multi-feature ﬂame recognition algorithm, a novel ﬂame recognition algorithm based on free radical emission spectroscopy during combustion is investigated in this paper. First, multiple features are extracted from the video images by employing our proposed processing scheme. Then, the features are post-processed by a temporal smoothing algorithm to eliminate the error recognition rate, which is caused by the similar characteristics of objects between ﬂame-like and real ﬂame areas. In the temporal smoothing experiments, the proposed method achieves the true positive rates of 0.965 and 0.937 for butane ﬂames and forest ﬁre, respectively. Additionally, the spectral signals of {OH}, {CH}, C2 and other free radicals in the combustion objects were acquired by the spectrometer. The vibrational temperature and rotational temperature are calculated after identiﬁcation of the A2D ﬁ X2P transition of the {CH} (410–440 nm). The ﬂames-like are completely rejected by the proposed method in the validation experiment. In the subsequent butane combustion experiment, the vibrational temperature of the butane was 4896 K, and the rotational temperature was 2290 K. The experimental results show that real ﬁres can be precisely recognized and that the combustion temperature can be determined from the {CH} emission spectroscopy. This novel method provides a new viewpoint for ﬁre detection and recognition.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of ﬁrebrands collected from a recent urban ﬁre in Japan are described. Speciﬁcally, this ﬁre broke out from a Chinese restaurant in Itoigawa-city, Niigata, Japan on December 22nd 2016. On the day of the ﬁre, strong winds resulted in rapid ﬁre spread. With the presence of an average wind speed of 9 m/s, the ﬁre quickly spread, resulting in the damage of 147 structures, with 120 of 147 destroyed. The ﬁre was extinguished more than 30 h later. During the ﬁre, ﬁrebrands were observed and 10 spot ﬁres were reported. After the ﬁre, investigations were performed and ﬁrebrands were collected from the burn site. The size and the mass of ﬁrebrands were measured and compared with the available literature data. It was observed that more than 60\% of the collected ﬁrebrands had less than 0.10 g mass and 2.0 cm2 projected area and the size and the mass of ﬁrebrands were independent of the location. The size and the mass of ﬁrebrands from this ﬁre were similar to those from another urban ﬁre under similar wind speed and were also compared to those produced from a ﬁrebrand generator. The ﬁrebrand data set presented here provided valuable insights into how ﬁrebrands are generated from structures in actual urban ﬁres. Finally, the description on how a ﬁrebrand generator may be used to produce ﬁrebrands similar to urban ﬁres yields an important advancement to begin to study such complex phenomena in the laboratory.},

A quantitative understanding of the short distance spotting dynamics, namely the ﬁrebrand density distribution within a distance from the ﬁre front and how distinct ﬁres coalesce in a highly turbulent environment, is still lacking. To address this, a custom software was developed in order to detect the location and the number of ﬂying ﬁrebrands in a thermal image then determine the temperature and sizes of each ﬁrebrand. The software consists of two modules, the detector and the tracker. The detector determines the location of the ﬁrebrands in the frame, and the tracker compares the ﬁrebrand in diﬀerent frames and determines the identiﬁcation number of each ﬁrebrand. Comparison of the calculated results with the data obtained by the independent experts and experimental data showed that the maximum relative error does not exceed 12\% for the low and medium number of ﬁrebrands in the frame (less than 30) and software agrees well with experimental observations for ﬁrebrands {\textgreater} 20 9 10-5 m. It was found that ﬁreline intensity below 12,590 {kW} m-1 does not change signiﬁcantly 2D ﬁrebrand ﬂux for ﬁrebrands bigger than 20 9 10-5 m, while occasional crowning can increase the ﬁrebrand ﬂux in several times. The developed software allowed us to analyse the thermograms obtained during the ﬁeld experiments and to measure the velocities, sizes and temperatures of the ﬁrebrands. It will help to better understand of how the ﬁrebrands can ignite the surrounding fuel beds and could be an important tool in investigating ﬁre propagation in communities.},

	abstract = {Data collection in the ﬁeld is fundamental in providing relevant information during ﬁre spread across vegetation or in industrial environments. Considering the challenge and costs of obtaining measurements in the presence of a ﬁre at such a large scale, the development of non-intrusive optical methods is a good alternative. As part of an ongoing eﬀort to improve the understanding of wildﬁre spread and provide useful tools for ﬁre management, an image-based diagnostic system is being developed for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the turbulent ﬂame in the ﬁeld. The method allows the time-resolved measurement of the geometric ﬂame features (height, surface area and volume). This paper presents the application of two synchronized stereovision systems to static line of ﬁre scenarios. Each stereovision system, with 1 m inter-camera distance, was located at 12 m from the ﬁre and captured complementary images from front and rear views. Dual spectral band (visible-{NIR}) cameras were used to enhance ﬁre pixel detection. A series of experiments were carried out on 5 m long and 2 m wide beds of excelsior in the open with fuel loads of 2, 4 and 8 kg/m2. The maximum ﬂame heights were in the range of 1.2–2.4 m. Measurement of the heat ﬂux densities was performed at several positions using thermopiletype sensors. Peak heat ﬂuxes of 6.4–15.7 {kW}/m2 were measured at 3 m from the ﬁre. The thermal radiation impinging ahead of the ﬂame front was characterized according to its geometric properties. The results exhibit not only a linear relationship between the ﬂame volume and radiant heat ﬂux but also high correlations between their temporal ﬂuctuations. The image processing technique enables measurements of ﬂame volume to be a reliable substitute for the usual ﬁre thermal properties.},

	abstract = {A new instrument to quantify ﬁrebrand dynamics during ﬁres with particular focus on those associated with the Wildland-Urban Interface ({WUI}) has been developed. During {WUI} ﬁres, ﬁrebrands can ignite spot ﬁres, which can rapidly increase the rate of spread ({ROS}) of the ﬁre, provide a mechanism by which the ﬁre can pass over ﬁrebreaks and are the leading cause of structure ignitions. Despite this key role in driving wildﬁre dynamics and hazards, diﬃculties in collecting ﬁrebrands in the ﬁeld and preserving their physical condition (e.g. dimensions and temperature) have limited the development of knowledge of ﬁrebrand dynamics. In this work we present a new, ﬁeld-deployable diagnostic tool, an emberometer, designed to provide measurement of ﬁrebrand ﬂuxes and information on both the geometry and the thermal conditions of ﬁrebrands immediately before deposition by combining a visual and infrared camera. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to calibrate and validate the developed imaging techniques. The emberometer was then deployed in the ﬁeld to explore ﬁrebrand ﬂuxes and particle conditions for a range of ﬁre intensities in natural pine forest environments. In addition to ﬁrebrand particle characterization, ﬁeld observations with the emberometer enabled detailed time history of deposition (i.e. ﬁrebrand ﬂux) relative to concurrent in situ ﬁre behaviour observations. We highlight that deposition was characterised by intense, short duration ‘‘showers’’ that can be reasonably associated to spikes in the average ﬁre line intensity. The results presented illustrate the potential use of an emberometer in studying ﬁrebrand and spot ﬁre dynamics.},

	abstract = {Firebrand ignition of wildland fuels is an important pathway of initiation and propagation of wildland and wildland-urban interface ﬁres. The ambient wind plays an important role in smouldering ignition of wildland fuels by ﬁrebrands, but its inﬂuence is poorly stated. In this work, the eﬀect of ambient wind on the ignition of a moist pine needle fuel bed by a glowing ﬁrebrand was investigated. Two ignition outcomes, smouldering or failed ignition, were observed. Wind was found to have a signiﬁcant impact on the ignition process by aﬀecting the glowing combustion state of the ﬁrebrand. As the wind velocity increased from zero to 4 m/s, the smouldering ignition probability ﬁrstly increased and then decreased, while the smouldering ignition delay time decreased. Under the same wind conditions, the ignition probability decreased while the smouldering ignition delay time increased as the fuel moisture content increased from 5.9\% to 53.2\%. A theoretical model based on the glowing combustion rate of ﬁrebrand and heat transfer between the ﬁrebrand and the fuel bed under the eﬀect of wind was proposed. The model predicted the variation trend of the smoldering ignition delay time with the wind velocity well when {FMC} was less than 20\%, but poor at higher {FMC}. It also predicted that the square root of ignition delay time had a good linear relationship with {FMC}. This work is a step forward in understanding of spot ﬁres initiated by glowing ﬁrebrands.},

Tests in an oven (uncontrolled ambient composition, imposed ambient temperature) were ﬁrst carried out to screen the effect of different parameters, including particle size, amount of material, moisture content, material compaction, heating rate, and storage geometry, on the onset and development of smouldering. The thermal ignition of pine bark was observed starting from 190 °C. Experiments carried out in a ﬂow tubular reactor (imposed ambient temperature and composition) were also carried out. The main produced gases analyzed under different ignition conditions, and concentrations of {CO}, {CO}2, H2 and O2 were measured and discussed. The ﬂow results indicated that pine bark evolves into smouldering supported by a minimum oxygen concentration, at low enough ﬂuxes to limit the material cooling due to convection. Finally, the ratio {CO}/{CO}2 monitored identiﬁes different oxidation stages during the smouldering process.},

	abstract = {Spotting during wildﬁres can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the way wildﬁres spread and reduce the chances of successful containment by ﬁre crews. However, there is little published empirical evidence of the phenomenon. In this study, we have analysed spotting patterns observed from 251 wildﬁres from a database of over 8000 aerial line scan images capturing active wildﬁre across mainland southeast Australia between 2002 and 2018. The images were used to measure spot ﬁre numbers, number of “long-distance” spot ﬁres ({\textgreater} 500 m), and maximum spotting distance. We describe three types of spotting distance distributions, compare patterns among diﬀerent regions of southeast Australia, and associate these with broad measures of rainfall, elevation, and fuel type. We found a relatively high correlation between spotting distance and numbers; however, there were also several cases of wildﬁres with low spot ﬁre numbers producing very long-distance spot ﬁres. Most long-distance spotting was associated with a “multi-modal” distribution type, where high numbers of spot ﬁres ignite close to the source ﬁre and isolated or small clumps of spot ﬁres ignite at longer distances. The multi-modal distribution suggests that current models of spotting distance, which typically follow an exponential-shaped distribution, could underestimate long-distance spotting. We also found considerable regional variation in spotting phenomena that may be associated with signiﬁcant variation in rainfall, topographic ruggedness, and fuel descriptors. East Victoria was the most spot-ﬁre-prone of the regions, particularly in terms of long-distance spotting.},

	abstract = {The probability of structural ignition is dependent both on physical properties of materials and the ﬁre exposure conditions. In this study, the effect of ﬁrebrand characteristics (i.e., ﬁrebrand size, number of ﬁrebrands) on wood ignition behavior was considered. Mathematical modeling and laboratory experiment were conducted to better understand the conditions of wood ignition by a single or group of ﬁrebrands with different geometry. This model considers the heat exchange between the ﬁrebrands, wood layer and the gas phase, moisture evaporation in the ﬁrebrands and the diffusion gases of water vapor in the pyrolysis zone. In order to test and verify the model, a series of experiments to determine probability and conditions for ignition of wood-based materials (plywood, oriented strand board, chipboard) caused by wildland ﬁrebrands (pine twigs with a diameter of 6–8 mm and a length of 40 ± 2 mm) were conducted. The experiments investigated the ﬁrebrand impact on the wood layer under different parameters, such as ﬁrebrand size and quantity, wind speed, and type of wood. The results of experiments showed that the increase in wind speed leads to the increase in probability of wood ignition. Based on the received results, it can be concluded that the ignition curve of wood samples by ﬁrebrands is nonlinear and depends on the wind speed and ﬁrebrand size as well as their quantity. At the same time, there is no ignition of wood samples in the range of wind speed of 0–1 m/s. The ignition of wood is possible with a decrease in the distance between the ﬁrebrands with a decrease in the ﬁrebrand length. This result agrees more closely with the model.},

	abstract = {Source terms of the number of firebrands released as trees/shrubs torch are essential for helping to more accurately implement detailed physics-based models of wildfire propagation, particularly when torching occurs. A key challenge in estimating these source terms is the difficulty in measuring firebrand generation rates from the source. Typical studies have reported generation characteristics (firebrands/m
              2
              ), but enumeration of the total number of firebrands released has remained elusive. Recently, a fire-resistant fabric was successfully employed to quantify “hot” firebrands (i.e., can potentially lead to further fire spread) generated during tree-scale burns. In this paper, a total of 71 tree/shrubs were burned to quantify hot firebrand production statistics for Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and sagebrush. A network of 65 fire-resistant fabric stations were deployed during the burns to measure the “hot” firebrands that are released. These stations are placed strategically at several radii and angles in the prominent wind direction. Using the number of firebrands determined from the fabric, a first-order extrapolation method was developed and evaluated to estimate the source terms (i.e., total number of hot firebrands released). Variation in the firebrand production with the height of the trees and for three species is reported. The total number of hot firebrands produced typically increased with the height of the tree/shrub burned as expected. The specific hot firebrand production (firebrands produced per kg dry mass burned) is exponentially dependent on the moisture content of the tree and had an inconclusive correlation with the height of the trees. Overall, for trees of comparable moisture content, sagebrush produced higher specific hot firebrands when compared to ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir species.},

	abstract = {The hazards associated with firebrands have been well documented. However, there exist few studies that allow for the hazard from a given fire to be quantified. To develop predictive tools to evaluate this hazard, it is necessary to understand the conditions that govern firebrand generation and those that affect firebrand deposition. A method is presented that allows for time-resolved measurements of fire behavior to be related to the dynamics of firebrand deposition. Firebrand dynamics were recorded in three fires undertaken in two different ecosystems. Fire intensity is shown to drive firebrand generation and firebrand deposition—higher global fire intensities resulting in the deposition of more, larger firebrands at a given distance from the fire front. Local firebrand dynamics are also shown to dominate the temporal firebrand deposition with periods of high fire intensity within a fire resulting in firebrand shower at deposition sites at times commensurate with firebrand transport. For the range of conditions studied, firebrand deposition can be expected up to 200 m ahead of the fire line based on extrapolation from the measurements.},

The technical description of the {TSC} design and a formulation of the proposed calibration technique are presented. This methodology allows for the quantiﬁcation of irradiation by means of an a posteriori analysis based on a temperature measurement from the {TSC}, a temperature measurement of the gas-phase in the vicinity of the {TSC} and a correction factor deﬁned during a pre-test calibration process. The proposed calibration methodology is designed to account for uncertainties inherent to the simplicity of the irradiation measurement technique, therefore not requiring precise information regarding material thermal and optical properties. This methodology is designed and presented so as to enable adaption of the technique to meet the speciﬁc requirements of other experimental setups. This is conveyed by means of an example detailing the design and calibration of a device designed for a series of large-scale experiments as part of the ‘Real Fires for the Safe Design of Tall Buildings’ project.},

Trajectories modelled with and without the assumption that the firebrands’ relative velocities always equal their terminal velocities are. Various models for the flight and combustion of disc- and cylindrical-shaped firebrands are evaluated. Eight simulations are performed with surface fuel fires and four simulations are performed with combined surface and canopy fuels. Firebrand trajectories without terminal velocity are larger than those from models with terminal velocity. Discs travel further than cylinders, as discs are aerodynamically more favourable. Thin discs burning on their faces and tall cylinders burning around their circumference have shorter lifetimes than thin discs burning from their circumference or longer cylinders burning from their ends. Firebrands from canopy fires, with larger size and potential to ignite recipient fuel, travel further than firebrands from surface fires. In the simulations, which included a line fire ignition in homogeneous fuels on flat terrain, the firebrand launching patterns are very heterogeneous, and the trajectories and landing patterns are dominated by the coupled fire–atmosphere behaviour.},

Results yielded by the proposed models for a demonstration problem involving cylindrical winddriven firebrands, with the same initial volume, mass and position, but different initial aspect ratios and distinct initial orientations relative to the wind velocity, are then presented. These results show the following: the horizontal distance travelled by the firebrand from release to landing locations is an increasing function of its initial aspect ratio; and the initial orientation of the firebrand, and its subsequent oscillations including possible rotation, have a significant influence on its trajectory, thus it is important to account for them in mathematical models formulated for predicting the spread of fires by spotting.},

	abstract = {Background. Peatland wildfires involve flaming vegetation and smouldering peat. The smoul­ dering behaviour strongly depends on peat moisture, which can change significantly and quickly due to weather or human activities. Aims. We simulated wildfire in peatlands at the field scale and, for the first time, included daily variations of peat moisture. Methods. We developed {KAPAS} {II}, a cellular automaton that includes flaming and smouldering, and coupled it with {PEATCLSM} (Catchment Land Surface Model) for peatland hydrology. Key results. Compared with the satellite observations over 90 days of a 2018 wildfire in Borneo, {KAPAS} {II} predictions provide good agreement for burn scars (79\% accuracy) and for the number of smouldering hotspots (85\% accuracy). For the same burn scar, the model predicts that 54 ha of peat would smoulder when considering daily moisture variations, but only 12 ha if moisture was constant. Simulations at the same Borneo location, but in different years from 2000 to 2019, show the importance of seasons and climate events like El Niño. Conclusion. Temporal variations in peat moisture, which are strongly influenced by weather and climate, are important to predict the behaviour and severity of peatland wildfires. Implications. This model improves our under­ standing of wildfire behaviour in peatlands and can contribute to its mitigation.},

	abstract = {Background. Wildland fires that occur near communities, in the wildland–urban interface ({WUI}), can inflict significant damage to urban structures. Although computational models are vital in wildfires, they often focus solely on wildland landscapes. Aim. We conducted a computational study to investigate {WUI} fire spread, encompassing both urban and wildland landscapes. Methods. We developed a 1D landscape-scale semi-physical model by integrating a semiphysical urban fire spread model into an Eulerian level set model of wildfire. The model includes ignition and spread through radiation, direct flame contact and ember deposition. Key results. Through a parametric study, we compare the relative change of spread rate from various structural properties and landscape layouts represented by model parameters, highlighting the significant impact of fire-resistant structure materials over surface treatments. Layout configura­ tions play a pivotal role in fire spread, with isolated islands of combustibles effective in reducing spread rate, aligning with existing mitigation strategies. Conclusion. Despite using a 1D domain and limitations on spatial and temporal variability, our model provides insights into underlying phenomena observed in {WUI} fires and their mitigation. It offers early-stage development of strategies for managing structure materials and landscape layouts. Implications. Our model and findings provide insights into {WUI} fire dynamics, paving the way for advanced mitigation strategies.},

This paper presents an experimental and modelling study on the flaming and smouldering burning of wood firebrands under forced convection. Methods. The firebrand burning experiments were conducted with different wind speeds and firebrand sizes. Key results. The burning rate of firebrands under forced convection is quantified by wood pyrolysis rate, char oxidation rate and a convective term. The firebrand projected area is correlated with firebrand diameter, char density, wind speed, and flaming or smouldering burning. A surface temperature model is derived in terms of condensed-phase energy conservation. We finally establish a simplified firebrand transport model based on the burning rate, projected area and surface temperature of firebrands. Conclusion. The mass loss due to wood pyrolysis is much greater than that due to char oxidation in self-sustaining burning. The burning rate is proportional to U1/2, where U is wind speed. The projected area for flaming firebrands decreases more rapidly than that for smouldering ones. The firebrand surface temperature is mainly determined by radiation. Implications. Knowledge about firebrand burning characteristics is essential for predicting the flight distance and trajectory in firebrand transport.},

	abstract = {Combustibility of insulation and external façade remains a critical issue for many countries as they are commonly found in modern building structures. While standardised fire tests can be carried out to examine the flammability limits of building polymers, they cannot inform us of the toxicity and smoke productions of the underlying materials. With recent advancements in computational approaches (i.e. surface regression porous media pyrol­ ysis model as depicted in Fig. 1) and its synergy with experimental characterisation techniques, a systematic framework is proposed to robustly realise the potential risks associated with any building polymer samples. This involves a five-step procedure including (i) performing {TGA} on the core polymer materials to acquire thermal and gas decomposition data; (ii) extracting pyrolysis kinetics data from {TGA} results via an initial estimation of the Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose method; (iii) optimise kinetics parameters via a shuffled complex evolution ({SCE}) algorithms to match {DTG} curves for an accurate representation of the degradation behaviour; (iv) conduct reduce-scale simulations via computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) in a cone calorimeter environment and compare against experimental data with/without aluminium covering for validation; (v) use the validated model to predict gaseous products, toxicity and soot particles releases and benchmark against Cone Calorimeter data. Once this database is established, it can be used for up-scaled modelling in a multiple-storey building setting. In this work, one of the most commonly applied building polymers for insulation applications and external façade systems: polyethelene ({PE}) is taken as an example to establish a numerical database. To learn whether the effect of flame-retardants that suppresses the flammability and intermediate combustion gases releases of {PE} can be replicated in the {CFD} modelling, the {PE} was also treated by plasma treatment subsequently immersed by gra­ phene oxide as fillers. The reductions in heat, smoke and carbon monoxide releases were benchmarked against the pure {PE} data while the increased char formation offered by the carbon-based enhancing agent is examined from a numerical perspective.},

In this study, in order to predict the scattering of firebrands in an urban fire, a computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}), turbulent combustion model, radiation model, and firebrand scattering model are coupled and it is validated by a fire wind tunnel experiment. The density, terminal velocity, and Stokes diameters of firebrands which are necessary for the firebrand scattering model are measured. The ratio of Stokes diameter to equivalent diameter is focused on 0.2–0.7. An urban fire simulation in a modeled urban area has been conducted using the coupled model and the firebrand experimental data. It is found that when the inflow wind velocity is comparatively slow, the size of the thermal plume becomes significant, and when the inflow wind velocity is high, the thermal plume is suppressed and greatly inclines to the leeward side, which increases the risk of the fire spreading to neighboring buildings. Firebrands can be scattered over 400 m. Firebrands are blown up by the thermal plume and the scattering distances are influenced by the background flow field, the magnitude of thermal plume, and the Stokes diameters of firebrands.},

In the current work, Controlled Atmosphere Pyrolysis Apparatus {II} tests were performed on representative gram-sized oriented strand board samples at a range of radiant heat fluxes. An automated inverse analysis of the sample temperature data obtained in these tests was employed to determine the thermal conductivities of the undecomposed oriented strand board and condensed-phase products of its decomposition. A complete pyrolysis model was formulated for this material and used to predict the mass loss rates measured in the Controlled Atmosphere Pyrolysis Apparatus {II} experiments. These mass loss rate profiles were predicted well with the exception of the second mass loss rate peak observed at 65 {kW} m22 of radiant heat flux, which was underpredicted. To further validate the model, cone calorimeter tests were performed on oriented strand board at 25 and 50 {kW} m22 of radiant heat flux. The results of these tests, including both mass loss rate and heat release rate profiles, were predicted reasonably well by the model.},

In this study, a twodimensional computational model was proposed to study the glowing combustion of a wooden ember. A global char oxidation reaction was used to represent the glowing combustion of the ember. A parametric study showed that the porosity, heat of reaction, and oxygen concentration were the most influential parameters on the ember combustion. Then, the model was compared to a series of bench-scale experiments in terms of glowing time and thermal response of a nonreacting substrate when exposed to a hot ember. The simulation results showed that ember combustion was mostly diffusion-controlled rather than kinetic-controlled. Thus, given the ember diversities in spotting fire, modelers should pay more attention to the difference in the physical properties instead of the kinetics between ember species.},

Variants of Tachikawa's transport models have been developed for different shapes of debris but, only simpliﬁed versions are implemented in ﬁrebrand transport models. Failure to include lift and rotational forces reduces the problem to a two-dimensional one, in contrast to the 3D trajectories observed. As such, many studies may have under-/overestimated the ﬂight distance and failed to capture the spotting distribution, accurately. Also, there is virtually no detailed quantitative experimental validation available for rod-like debris transport models. Hence, a set of free-fall experiments with non-combusting model ﬁrebrands were run in the absence of cross-wind. The results are employed for veriﬁcation and performance evaluation of a 3D deterministic 6-{DegreesOf}-Freedom ({DOF}) rod-like debris transport model. It is shown that a transport model must include the complete 6-{DOF} aerodynamics of the debris for estimating the ﬂight characteristics, such that results are not statistically signiﬁcantly different from the experimental data. The ﬁndings have applications beyond ﬁrebrand transport, as they represent the most comprehensive experimental data set and analysis of rod-like debris transport, currently in the literature.},

	abstract = {Forest fire is a critical disaster that causes massive destruction of forest ecosystem and economic loss. Hence, accurate estimation of the burned area is important for evaluation of the degree of damage and for preparing baseline data for recovery. Since most of the area size damaged by wildfires in Korea is less than 1 ha, it is necessary to use satellite or drone images with a resolution of less than 10m for detecting the damage area. This paper aims to detect wildfire-damaged area from a Kompsat-3 image using the indices such as {NDVI} (normalized difference vegetation index) and {FBI} (fire burn index) and to examine the classification characteristics according to the methods such as Otsu thresholding and {ISODATA} (iterative self-organizing data analysis technique). To mitigate the salt-and-pepper phenomenon of the pixel-based classification, a gaussian filter was applied to the images of {NDVI} and {FBI}. Otsu thresholding and {ISODATA} could distinguish the burned forest from normal forest appropriately, and the salt-and-pepper phenomenon at the boundaries of burned forest was reduced by the gaussian filter. The result from {ISODATA} with gaussian filter using {NDVI} was closest to the official record of damage area (56.9 ha) published by the Korea Forest Service. Unlike Otsu thresholding for binary classification, since the {ISODATA} categorizes the images into multiple classes such as (1) severely burned area, (2) moderately burned area, (3) mixture of burned and unburned areas, and (4) unburned area, the characteristics of the boundaries consisting of burned and normal forests can be better expressed. It is expected that our approach can be utilized for the high-resolution images obtained from other satellites and drones.},

While the demand for plastic products is growing, from the 29.5 Mt of collected waste in Europe only 35\% was recycled, while 42\% represents energy recovery and 23\% was landfilled in 2020 [1]. Plastic pyrolysis provides a promising alternative method to utilize plastic waste as secondary raw material [2]. An advantage over traditional waste processing methods is the possibility to obtain valuable products with pyrolysis. The products obtained from thermal decomposition are the pyrolysis coke, gas and oil. {GC}-{MS} analysis showed that the composition of the plastic waste gasoline ({PWG}) derived from low- and high-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene show similarity to commercially available gasoline. It is possible to operate {IC} engines using {PWG}, however, certain parameters such as the olefin concentration do not meet the {EN}-228 European gasoline standard, therefore further refinement, such as hydrotreatment is needed to achieve standard quality. Another advantage of this method is the utilization of the gaseous pyrolysis product. The pyrolysis gas consists of high concentrations of combustible hydrocarbons with C1-C4 carbon numbers. In part the gas could be used to provide the energy requirements of the process.},

	abstract = {Spot fires pose a major risk and add to the already complex physics, which makes fire spread so hard to predict, especially in the wildland urban interface. Firebrands can not only cross fuel breaks and thwart other suppression efforts but also directly damage infrastructure and block evacuation routes. Transport models and computational fluid dynamics tools often make simplifications when predicting spot fire risk, but there is a relative lack of experimental data to validate such parameterizations. To this end, we present a field experiment performed at the University of California Berkeley Blodgett Research Forest in California where we recorded the flame and firebrands emanating from a nighttime hand-drawn pile fire using high-frequency imaging. We used image-processing to characterize the fire intensity and turbulence as well as particle tracking velocimetry to measure ejected firebrand kinematics as they are lofted by the plume. We further collected embers that settled around the fire at varying distances and measured their size, shape, density, and settling distributions. We also examine existing physics-based time-averaged models of firebrand lofting and note discrepancies between such models, often used due to their speed and simplicity, and our experimental observations. Finally, we discuss some implications our observations could have on future modeling efforts by considering the time-dependent fire dynamics, intermittency in the plume turbulence, and in the firebrand generation rate. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first in situ observations of firebrand generation and lofting from representative fuels, addressing a major source of data gap and uncertainty in the wildland fire literature.},

            Wildfires burn millions of hectares per year on every inhabited continent, but the physical mechanism governing spread is not known. Models of wildfire spread are widely used for prediction, firefighter training, and ecological research but have assumed various formulations of known heat transfer processes (radiation and convection) absent a definitive theory of their organization. New experimental evidence reported here reveals how buoyancy generated by the fire induces vorticity and instabilities in the flame zone that control the convective heating needed to ignite fuel particles and produce spread.
          ,
            Large wildfires of increasing frequency and severity threaten local populations and natural resources and contribute carbon emissions into the earth-climate system. Although wildfires have been researched and modeled for decades, no verifiable physical theory of spread is available to form the basis for the precise predictions needed to manage fires more effectively and reduce their environmental, economic, ecological, and climate impacts. Here, we report new experiments conducted at multiple scales that appear to reveal how wildfire spread derives from the tight coupling between flame dynamics induced by buoyancy and fine-particle response to convection. Convective cooling of the fine-sized fuel particles in wildland vegetation is observed to efficiently offset heating by thermal radiation until convective heating by contact with flames and hot gasses occurs. The structure and intermittency of flames that ignite fuel particles were found to correlate with instabilities induced by the strong buoyancy of the flame zone itself. Discovery that ignition in wildfires is critically dependent on nonsteady flame convection governed by buoyant and inertial interaction advances both theory and the physical basis for practical modeling.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Increased forest fire activity across the western United States in recent decades has contributed to widespread forest mortality, carbon emissions, periods of degraded air quality, and substantial fire suppression expenditures. Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western {US} forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.
          ,
            Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States ({US}) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western {US} forests over the past several decades and, during 2000–2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({\textgreater}1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western {US} forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984–2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

It is often pyrolysis and combustion products that cause deaths from fires in closed spaces. Fire sprinkler system activation does not always lead to efficient smoke deposition. Sometimes, a fire sup­ pression liquid supply, on the contrary, deteriorates fire evacuation conditions. The study of smoke gen­ eration and deposition characteristics is an essential prerequisite for improving rescue technologies during fires. The purpose of this research was to define the characteristics of deposition of solid combustion product particles of a group of typical construction and finishing materials in closed spaces: wood, lino­ leum, rubber, etc. Solid particles (pyrolysis products) have been distributed by size and concentration. The smoke generation and extinction coefficients, as well as deposition rates of smoke aerosol particles with and without using water aerosol have been determined. The ranges of optical properties of smoke aerosol have been specified. The time of dispersed water impact on smoke aerosol was varied to evaluate its effect on the mass rate of deposition of solid combustion product particles. The characteristics of absorption of laser radiation with different wavelengths in flue gases have been defined to identify the most advanta­ geous colors of reflector materials used to manufacture direction signs for the evacuation of people from the combustion zone.},

	abstract = {Thermal insulation materials are important for building energy conservation, but their wastes have increased sharply. Furthermore, pyrolysis and combustion are increasingly utilized to dispose of solid wastes and convert them into value-added fuels. To better understand the pyrolysis and combustion characteristics of these materials, typical thermal insulation materials (expanded polystyrene ({EPS}) and extruded polystyrene ({XPS})) were investigated by employing thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry as well as cone calorimetry experiments. Pyrolysis behavior, kinetic parameters, pyrolysis index, thermodynamic parameters, endothermic properties and combustion parameters were estimated comprehensively. The results showed that {EPS} had better pyrolysis properties, while {XPS} had better combustion characteristics. Activation energies of {EPS} and {XPS} were 158.82 {kJ}/mol and 200.70 {kJ}/ mol, respectively. Additionally, {EPS} had a higher pyrolysis stability index and comprehensive pyrolysis index, meaning a more intense reaction. Moreover, thermodynamic parameters indicated that the devolatilization products could be obtained easily from the two materials, and {EPS} and {XPS} could be converted into fuels. For the combustion, {XPS} had a smaller ﬁre performance index and a larger ﬁre growth index. These results can guide the reactor design and optimization for better converting polymer wastes into fuels and managing wastes.},

	abstract = {Despite increasing concern over wildfires in Fennoscandia, there are essentially no studies on the survivability of buildings within the wildland-urban interface of this region. We make use of four recent large-scale fires in Sweden to elucidate which factors are important for survival, using multiple logistic regression analysis of data collected at the sites. We obtained data on 187 buildings within the fire perimeters, nearly all with wood paneling and tile- or sheet metal roofing. 35 \% of the buildings were lost or badly damaged. Results indicate that most buildings were approached by relatively low-intensity fire and that ignition primarily occurred through direct flame contact. The most important factor for survivability was the presence of a maintained lawn. The second most important was that no flammable material was present close to the building façade. Further, fire intensity often decreased close to buildings due to a larger portion of deciduous trees around gardens than in the surrounding forest. These factors were more important than specific features of the building itself, reflecting that the majority of buildings have combustible wooden façades. Our results suggest that the greatest potential for increasing building safety in the Swedish {WUI} is to keep the area immediately surrounding the building ({\textasciitilde}5 m) free from tree litter and other flammable material. Also, since fire intensities are generally low, buildings can in most cases be defended with simple tools without compromising personal safety.},
