	abstract = {The condensing gas boiler technology has received increasing attention due to its very high eﬃciency of more than 90\%, which is an increase of more than 15\% compared to non-condensing boiler devices. With this, condensing gas boilers oﬀer the chance to decrease the energy consumption and {CO}2 emissions for domestic hot water and heating. While further increasing the energy eﬃciency of condensing boiler devices, pollutant emissions have to be considered as well since they are a threat to human health and therefore subject to continuously intensiﬁed governmental restrictions. In this study, a comprehensive investigation of the full-scale heating unit of a commercial condensing gas boiler was performed. Local measurements at diﬀerent axial positions revealed an inhomogeneous distribution of {CO} and {NO} emissions due to varying temperature levels in the burnt region. Resolved simulations with ﬁnite rate chemistry identiﬁed a quenching of the {CO} oxidation reactions due to a fast depletion of {OH} radicals. Consequently, the {CO} concentration in the cooled exhaust gas is signiﬁcantly higher than expected from chemical equilibrium calculations. Regarding {NO} formation, the majority of {NO} is found to be produced within the ﬂame front, while only a small part is formed in the postﬂame region. A detailed pathway analysis pointed out that besides the well known thermal {NO} pathway, the {NNH} pathway has the highest contribution to the overall {NO} emissions. These insights open up possibilities to develop new condensing boiler generations where emission levels below the permitted limits can be achieved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for accurate laminar flame speed measurements relevant to engine operating temperature and pressure conditions, where literature data are scarce or non-existent. The experimental setup consists of a high-pressure, high-temperature spherical chamber that combines optical and pressurerise data collection techniques. The optical method is based on high-speed recordings of flame images using a schlieren setup, whereas the pressure-rise approach requires pressure measurements of isentropically compressed unburned gases taken during flame propagation. The range of usable data in the pressure-rise method is limited by stretch effects at lower pressures and the onset of instabilities at higher pressures. Here, the lower pressure limit was extended using optical data measured at isentropic conditions. A criterion to define the upper-pressure limit is proposed by the onset of instabilities during combustion that is especially useful for pressure readings taken in spherical chambers without optical access. Experimental laminar flame speeds are compared to those obtained with simulations using two detailed kinetic models, where very good agreement is found. Finally, a well-defined procedure is proposed showing how to obtain an extensive range of experimentally accurate laminar flame speed data that can be used to validate kinetic schemes by using only few measurements.},

	abstract = {Laminar burning velocities are of great importance in many combustion models as well as for validation and improvement of chemical kinetic schemes. Determining laminar burning velocities with high accuracy is quite challenging and different approaches exist. Hence, a comparison of existing methods measuring and evaluating laminar burning velocities is of interest. Here, two optical diagnostics, high speed tomography and Schlieren cinematography, are simultaneously set up to investigate methods for evaluating laminar flame speed in a spherical flame configuration. The hypothesis to obtain the same flame propagation radii over time with the two different techniques is addressed. Another important aspect is the estimation of flame properties, such as the unstretched flame propagation speed and Markstein length in the burnt gas phase and if these are estimated satisfactorily by common experimental approaches. Thorough evaluation of the data with several extrapolation techniques is undertaken. A systematic extrapolation approach is presented to give more confidence into results generated experimentally. The significance of the linear extrapolation routine is highlighted in this context. Measurements of spherically expanding flames are carried out in two high-pressure, high-temperature, constant-volume vessels at {RWTH} in Aachen, Germany and at {ICARE} in Orleans, France. For the discussion of the systematic extrapolation approach, flame speed measurements of methane / air mixtures with mixture Lewis numbers moderately away from unity are used. Conditions were varied from lean to rich mixtures, at temperatures of 298–373 K, and pressures of 1 atm and 5 bar.},

Combustion in the gas phase is described using finite rate chemistry. The numerical results for ignition are compared with available experimental data and a remarkably good agreement is observed. The effect on flame ignition of the different phases characterizing the release of volatile gases is assessed. These different phases manifest themselves in two distinct peaks in the devolatilization rate and it is observed that ignition can occur during the first volatile release or on the onset of the second, depending on the particle size and gas temperature. It is found that an increase of ignition delay time in oxy-atmosphere compared to the air case is related to the depletion of radicals that react with the abundant carbon dioxide of the oxy-atmosphere, while the increased heat capacity of the mixture does not play a role.},

Therefore, detailed knowledge about the ongoing chemical kinetics in the combustion process is necessary. Here, we present an explorative approach to study volatile species gas phase kinetics in a novel coal-plate experiment probed with molecular-beam mass spectrometry. This coupling allows for time-resolved quantitative measurements of the gas-phase directly above the surface of solid fuels, which aid gaining more insight into the gas phase chemistry during coal combustion by detailed speciation information. Two coal samples, a rhenish lignite and a coal manufactured from hydrothermal carbonization, were chosen for this investigation due to their similar classification but different molecular structures. For both samples, our measurements show a two-stage devolatilization phase separated by a charoxidation phase which can be attributed to the interaction of oxygen consumption in the gas phase and on the surface and the release of volatiles from deeper layers of the plate. Furthermore, detailed speciation data of light, oxygenated, and tar species allowed to identify fuel structure-specific decomposition patterns of the two different coal materials, thus providing comprehensive data that can be used for future model validation purposes.},

	abstract = {Allene and 1-buten-3-yne (C4H4) represent important intermediates in forming polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soot. Hydrogen abstraction from allene provides the resonance-stabilized propargyl radical fueling molecular growth kinetics. However, the kinetics associated with 1-buten-3-yne and its involvement in the formation and growth of aromatics still need to be fully understood. One of the challenges is the complexity of the relevant chemistry in most combustion environments, which includes fuel-specific reactions in addition to reactions of C4 species. This work attempts to simplify the relevant chemistry by using 1-buten-3-yne as fuel for the first time in counterflow diffusion flames. A pure allene and a 75∕25 mol \% allene/1-buten-3-yne blend flame were examined using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The boundary and operating conditions feature close equilibrium temperature, stoichiometric mixture fraction, and strain rate, allowing a meaningful kinetic comparison between the flames. Speciation data from both instruments were consistent for the vast majority of the species. The experimental results were compared to simulations performed with an updated, extensively validated, detailed chemical kinetic model. Notably, adding 1-buten-3-yne to the fuel reduced benzene and increased the formation of naphthalene. This showcases that the availability of C3 and C4 species impacts the kinetics of the two species differently. Pathway analyses revealed that benzene formation highly depends on C3 species, while naphthalene relies on C3 and C4 species. Naphthalene formation depends on the abundance of 1,3-butadiyne (C4H2) and proceeds mainly via the C4 + 2 C3 and 2 C3 + C4 pathways. Other pathways, such as {HACA} and phenyl radical-addition to C4H4, exhibited a minor impact. The present work highlights that uncertainties in the C4H2-related chemistry are highly relevant for the modeling of aromatics and may affect naphthalene predictions. Therefore, the experimental data of this study will provide a unique validation target for future kinetic model development.},

	abstract = {Ignition and combustion of pulverized solid fuel is investigated in a laminar burner. The two-dimensional {OH} radical field is measured in the experiments, providing information on the first onset of ignition and a detailed characterization of the flame structure for the single particle. In addition, particle velocity and diameter are tracked in time in the experiments. Simulations are carried out with a Lagrangian point-particle approach fully coupled with an Eulerian solver for the gas-phase, which includes detailed chemistry and transport. The numerical simulation results are compared with the experimental measurements in order to investigate the ignition characteristics. The effect of the slip velocity, i.e. the initial velocity difference between the gas-phase and the particle, is investigated numerically. For increasing slip velocity, the ignition delay time decreases. For large slip velocities, the decrease in ignition delay time is found to saturate to a value which is about 40\% smaller than the ignition delay time at zero slip velocity. Performing a simulation neglecting the dependency of the Nusselt number on the slip velocity, it is found that this dependency does not play a role. On the contrary, it is found that the decrease of ignition delay time induced by the slip velocity is due to modifications of the temperature field around the particle. In particular, the low-temperature fluid related to the energy sink due to particle heating is transported away from the particle position when the slip velocity is non-zero; therefore, the particle is exposed to larger temperatures. Finally, the effect of particle swell is investigated using a model for the particle swelling based on the {CPD} framework. With this model, we observed negligible differences in ignition delay time compared to the case in which swelling is not included. This is related to the negligible swelling predicted by this model before ignition. However, this is inconsistent with the experimental measurements of particle diameter, showing a significant increase of diameter even before ignition. In further simulations, the measured swelling was directly prescribed, using an analytical fit at the given conditions. With this approach, it is found that the inclusion of swelling reduces the ignition delay time by about 20\% for small particles while it is negligible for large particles.},

	abstract = {While fuel combustion in oxygen-enriched environments provides a number of significant advantages, such as reduced nitrogen oxide emissions and high carbon dioxide purity for carbon sequestration, it is characterized by different physico-chemical oxidation behavior than combustion in air. Compared to nitrogen, carbon dioxide has different specific heat and effective Lewis number, and is chemically more active. Therefore, chemical mechanisms developed for the oxidation of fuel/air mixtures can fail to predict targets of interest for oxy-combustion accurately. In this study, a chemical mechanism of methane, which has been previously validated with data from experiments using air, is evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy at oxy-conditions by comparing against available literature data. The validation takes various combustion properties into account, including ignition delay times, laminar burning velocities, and extinction strain rates, and covers a wide range of experimental conditions with respect to temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, and carbon dioxide concentration. As additional targets, extinction strain rates of non-premixed oxy-methane flames are determined in a counterflow burner at conditions, where literature data have not yet been reported. The extensive validation demonstrates that the mechanism is able to describe oxy-methane combustion with reasonable prediction accuracy. For further insights into the underlying kinetics of diffusion flames of methane in oxy-atmosphere compared to its oxidation in air, reaction path and sensitivity analyses are performed using the validated mechanism. Notable differences between both combustion regimes are observed in the branching ratios of H-abstraction reactions by {OH} and H radicals and in the consumption channels of singlet methylene, which is a key species in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.},

Devolatilization of coal particles is modeled with the chemical percolation devolatilization ({CPD}) method coupled with a detailed chemistry model for homogeneous reactions. The particle and gas phase interactions are modeled with a fully coupled Euler-Lagrange code. A parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of particle number density, gas temperature, and velocity on ignition. We found that increasing particle number density delays the onset of ignition. Delayed ignition in denser streams is due to the lower gas temperature, which is caused by the higher energy required for particle heating. In addition, increasing particle number density leads to a more continuous and narrower flame front. Particle heating and ignition induce velocity variations in the gas phase through the coupling with particles. In the denser stream, velocity variations become significant and compromise the validity of a constant velocity assumption that is usually made in computing ignition delay time from the observed ignition location. It is also found that high particle slip velocities lead to a locally low volatile concentration and low temperature, and consequently increase ignition delay time.},

The investigations show that due to the high Stokes number of solid particles, they do not necessarily follow the flow. At Stokes numbers around unity, particle–turbulence interactions can lead to particle clustering and change the ignition behavior. According to observations, ignition is most likely to happen outside the formed clusters, where suitable thermo-chemical conditions exist. To study this behavior, direct numerical simulations ({DNS}) of reactive particles in turbulent conditions employing detailed kinetics for solid and gas phases were performed. Pulverized fuel combustion was modeled using the point-particle approximation to represent the dispersed phase in an Eulerian–Lagrangian framework. Isotropic turbulence was employed to investigate the influence of particle clustering on the ignition process. After investigating the physical aspects of the ignition process, the {DNS} dataset was used as a benchmark for evaluating the reduced-order flamelet models usually employed in {LES} of pulverized fuel combustion during the ignition process. The flamelet model performance in predicting the selected quantity of interest was compared to the {DNS} data. An error decomposition was performed using the optimal estimator concept. Finally, the prediction accuracy of presumed {PDFs} is evaluated by calculating the errors in predicting the quantity of interest using different {PDFs} compared to the predictions using the accurate sub-filter joint distribution of the {DNS} data.},

A deep understanding of the in-cylinder process is required for engine design and combustion controller development. To investigate the impact of different input parameters such as injection duration, injection timing, and substitution rate on varying output parameters like load, combustion phasing, and engine-out emissions, numerous investigations were conducted. Engine speed, global equivalence ratio, and injection pressure were held constant. The experiments were carried out in a modified single-cylinder compression ignition engine. The results reveal regimes with different dependencies between injection timing of diesel fuel and combustion phasing.

Ogi, Fully conservative ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme in cylindrical coordinates for incompressible ﬂow simulations, J. Comput. Phys. 197 (2004) 686] is extended to simulate variable density ﬂows in complex geometries with cylindrical or cartesian non-uniform meshes. The formulation discretely conserves mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in a periodic domain. In the presence of walls, boundary conditions that ensure primary conservation have been derived, while secondary conservation is shown to remain satisfactory. In the case of cylindrical coordinates, it is desirable to increase the order of accuracy of the convective term in the radial direction, where most gradients are often found. A straightforward centerline treatment is employed, leading to good accuracy as well as satisfactory robustness. A similar strategy is introduced to increase the order of accuracy of the viscous terms. The overall numerical scheme obtained is highly suitable for the simulation of reactive turbulent ﬂows in realistic geometries, for it combines arbitrarily high order of accuracy, discrete conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with consistent boundary conditions. This numerical methodology is used to simulate a series of canonical turbulent ﬂows ranging from isotropic turbulence to a variable density round jet. Both direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) and large eddy simulation ({LES}) results are presented. It is observed that higher order spatial accuracy can improve signiﬁcantly the quality of the results. The error to cost ratio is analyzed in details for a few cases. The results suggest that high order schemes can be more computationally eﬃcient than low order schemes.},
