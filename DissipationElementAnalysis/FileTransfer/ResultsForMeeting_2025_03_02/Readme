Images: RegimeDiagram_OHmax_variable
=> simulation case: OHmax (=0.65ms)
=> one point in the regime diagram refers to one DE (which has Zst inside)
=> x-axis: gprime = g / gq
    g: DNS data (DE gradient)
    gq: global value from flamelet
=> y-axis: dZprime = dZ / dZr
    dZ: DNS data (dZ from DE)
    dZr: reaction zone thickness from flamelet (global value, since T > 1500K)

gq calculation
=> see: DE_Analysis/Flamelets/Cantera/PostProcessingMATLAB/CreateFigures_TemperatureOverInverseDissipationRate.m

=> all post-processed figures from the flamelets are in DE_Analysis/Flamelets/Cantera/PostProcessingMATLAB/Figures
