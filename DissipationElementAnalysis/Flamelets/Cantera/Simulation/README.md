This file is an updated version of the file provided by H.Nicolai (used version 2.4, file: DiffusionFlame_CH4_batch_T_mix2.py)
=> H.Nicolai modified the source-code => can't reproduce the results
=> H.Nicolai used a 100 species mechanisms - we don't have this one(?), we use a 68 species mechanism (reduced version)
